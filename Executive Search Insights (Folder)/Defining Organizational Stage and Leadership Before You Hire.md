### Every Executive Search, CEO Executive Search, and Board Member Search must start with understanding the Organizational Stage, the DOES Leadership Model, and the balance between Management, Leadership, and Stewardship.

Hiring a senior leader is a design decision, not a transaction. When a board or CEO engages in an Executive Search, the first questions should be: What **Organizational Stage** is the company truly in? What balance of **management, leadership, and stewardship** does this role require? And how should these needs be expressed through [the DOES Leadership Model](https://josejruiz.com/leadership-folder/introduction-to-the-does-leadership-model/)—Design, Organize, Execute, and Sustain?  

When those questions are unclear, searches become reactive. Specifications read like wish lists, interviews drift, and the eventual hire works against the system instead of amplifying it. When they are answered with precision, Executive Search becomes an act of organizational design. You understand *which* kind of leader, at *what* level of work, and with *which* balance of management, leadership, and stewardship will move the organization forward.  

At its best, Executive Search aligns individual capability with institutional complexity. It ensures the right form of leadership emerges for the organization’s stage of development and strengthens governance coherence with every appointment—especially in CEO Executive Search and Board Member Search, where a single decision can shape the organization’s trajectory for years.

## The Organizational Stage as a Strategic Lens

Organizations evolve through distinct [Organizational Stages](https://josejruiz.com/organization-design-and-development-folder/the-evolution-of-organizational-capability/)—from founder-driven beginnings to adaptive maturity. Each stage represents a unique configuration of complexity, coordination, and time horizons.  

A **Stage Two** company, in rapid growth, requires managers who can create structure, prioritize effectively, and organize early systems. A **Stage Four** organization, operating at strategic coherence, needs leaders and stewards who can integrate foresight, governance, and ethics into decision-making. Misreading this stage leads to systemic friction: a hands-on manager is lost in strategic complexity, or a visionary leader drowns in operational chaos.

An organization’s stage is not about size—it is about **complexity and coherence**. It reflects how effectively decision rights, culture, and structure align to create flow. Understanding your Organizational Stage allows you to define not just *what* kind of leader is needed, but *how* they must manage, lead, and steward value across time.

## The DOES Leadership Model as a Blueprint for Contribution

[The DOES Leadership Model](https://josejruiz.com/leadership-folder/introduction-to-the-does-leadership-model/) transforms leadership from a personality-driven concept into a systemic framework of contribution. It defines *how* leaders create value through four integrated dimensions—**Design**, **Organize**, **Execute**, and **Sustain**—and allows boards and hiring teams to diagnose whether a role requires a manager, a leader, or a steward, or a blend of all three.  

- **Management** operates primarily through *Execute* and *Organize*: ensuring systems run smoothly, optimizing resources, and maintaining consistency.  
- **Leadership** is expressed through *Design* and *Execute*: envisioning possibilities, mobilizing people, and translating direction into coordinated action.  
- **Stewardship** anchors in *Sustain*: preserving coherence, ensuring ethical continuity, and safeguarding the organization’s long-term purpose.  

These are not separate categories—they are different forms of contribution that coexist within the DOES framework. At each Organizational Stage, the mix shifts. In early stages, management dominates because operational control defines success. As complexity grows, leadership becomes critical to shape direction and integrate systems. In mature stages, stewardship emerges as the central force, ensuring values, governance, and purpose endure.

## Understanding Capability, Ability, and Capacity

Before assessing management, leadership, or stewardship, it’s essential to distinguish **capability**, **ability**, and **capacity**—the three dimensions that determine whether an individual can handle the complexity of their context.  

**Capability** is the ability to make sense of and act within complexity—to think systemically and make judgments across time horizons. **Ability** reflects learned skills and experiences that enable performance in familiar contexts. **Capacity** refers to the scale and scope at which that ability and capability can be applied, across functions, systems, or ecosystems.  

A successful **CEO Executive Search** prioritizes capability first. Without it, even the most skilled manager cannot navigate the timespan and ambiguity inherent in the role. For a **Board Member Search**, capability becomes stewardship—the cognitive and ethical maturity to balance long-term purpose, risk, and societal impact.

## Writing the Specification as a Design Document

A well-constructed role specification is a **design document**, not a résumé checklist. It articulates the organization’s **stage**, its **balance of management, leadership, and stewardship**, and how those needs manifest through [the DOES Leadership Model](https://josejruiz.com/leadership-folder/introduction-to-the-does-leadership-model/).  

It begins by defining the **Organizational Stage** and describing what the leader will inherit—systems, structures, constraints, and opportunities. It then identifies which dimensions of the DOES Leadership Model are dominant for the next 24–36 months. It defines the **level of work**—the timespan of decisions and accountabilities—and clarifies the mix of management, leadership, and stewardship needed for success.  

Finally, it outlines how capability, ability, and capacity intersect with these needs, ensuring that each candidate evaluation tests the right kind of complexity and contribution.

## Applying the Framework to Different Types of Search

### CEO Executive Search

A CEO specification lives at the intersection of **Organizational Stage evolution**, the **balance of management, leadership, and stewardship**, and [the DOES Leadership Model](https://josejruiz.com/leadership-folder/introduction-to-the-does-leadership-model/).  

In an early-stage company moving from Stage Two to Stage Three, management and execution dominate—the CEO must organize and stabilize growth. At the transition from Stage Three to Stage Four, leadership takes precedence, requiring vision, integration, and cross-functional coherence. At Stage Five, stewardship becomes central, as the CEO sustains institutional integrity while embedding renewal and agility into the system.  

The CEO’s work, then, is not fixed—it evolves with the organization’s maturity. The right CEO for today may not be the right CEO for tomorrow if the balance among management, leadership, and stewardship shifts beyond their capability.

### Executive Search for Functional Leaders

Functional leaders embody the organization’s **management and leadership systems** in action. The COO, CFO, and CHRO each express different aspects of [the DOES Leadership Model](https://josejruiz.com/leadership-folder/introduction-to-the-does-leadership-model/) depending on context.  

A Stage Three COO thrives on execution and organization—building operational rhythm and consistency. A Stage Four CFO leads through design and sustain—shaping capital strategy, risk posture, and governance continuity. A CHRO spanning these stages orchestrates leadership and stewardship—developing talent, sustaining culture, and preparing the next generation of leaders.  

Functional roles that fail to evolve with the organization’s stage often become blockers to growth. Understanding where management ends and leadership or stewardship begins is the key to designing enduring success.

### Board Member Search

Boards embody **stewardship**. In advanced Organizational Stages, directors must focus on foresight, ethics, and sustainability—ensuring long-term alignment between strategy, values, and governance.  

In a Stage Four or Five organization, effective directors contribute through the **Sustain** and **Design** dimensions of the DOES Leadership Model. They do not manage the enterprise; they safeguard its purpose. The Board Member Search, therefore, must evaluate candidates not just for expertise, but for their ability to steward integrity, navigate uncertainty, and sustain continuity across generations of leadership.

## The Search Process as a Systemic Intervention

When conducted through the lenses of **Organizational Stage**, **management–leadership–stewardship balance**, and [the DOES Leadership Model](https://josejruiz.com/leadership-folder/introduction-to-the-does-leadership-model/), Executive Search becomes a systemic intervention rather than a transactional process.  

It begins with **diagnosis**, identifying the current stage, defining the kind of leadership work required, and clarifying the developmental trajectory of the organization. It proceeds through **fit definition**, ensuring candidate capability aligns with both stage and contribution type. The **search strategy** then targets ecosystems where the right balance of management, leadership, and stewardship experience exists.  

**Assessment** integrates structured interviews, psychometrics, and scenario exercises grounded in the DOES Leadership Model. **Presentation** connects biography to complexity—showing how a candidate’s way of thinking, leading, and sustaining aligns with the organization’s stage. **Validation** through 360 references confirms patterns of contribution, and **onboarding** becomes an act of design—ensuring early alignment and flow between individual and system.

## Evaluating Management, Leadership, and Stewardship Requirements

Every executive role contains elements of management, leadership, and stewardship—but their weight shifts with context. Evaluating a role requires clarity on three questions:

1. **What must be managed?**  
   What systems, processes, or deliverables require consistency, optimization, and control?

2. **What must be led?**  
   What changes, transformations, or integrations require inspiration, mobilization, and alignment?

3. **What must be stewarded?**  
   What values, commitments, and legacies must be preserved and renewed for the long term?

In a Stage Three company, management dominates; systems and execution are the levers of success. In a Stage Four organization, leadership becomes essential to unify diverse functions and shape strategy. In a Stage Five environment, stewardship defines continuity—leaders must sustain purpose through transition and renewal.

By explicitly naming these requirements within the DOES Leadership Model, organizations avoid mismatches between role design and candidate orientation.

## Translating Insight into Practice

For every **Executive Search**, the starting point is a clear articulation of the organization’s current **stage**, its required **balance of management, leadership, and stewardship**, and its dominant **DOES dimensions** for the next horizon.  

In **CEO Executive Search**, this determines whether the role is primarily about building systems, leading transformation, or sustaining legacy. In **Board Member Search**, it defines whether the board must actively guide strategy, oversee renewal, or preserve institutional integrity.

This clarity shortens searches, sharpens interviews, and aligns decisions around evidence instead of opinion.

## What Changes When You Start with Organizational Stage and the DOES Leadership Model

When organizations begin with these frameworks, three things happen. First, **strategy becomes clearer**, because leadership is contextualized within the organization’s developmental reality. Second, **alignment accelerates**, because the desired balance between management, leadership, and stewardship is explicit. Third, **transitions smooth out**, because both the organization and the incoming leader understand what kind of leadership work is required—now and next.

## The Discipline Behind Every Search

Every Executive Search, CEO Executive Search, or Board Member Search I lead begins with three disciplines: clarity of context, coherence of language, and consistency of evidence. The role specification functions as a design document—a blueprint of contribution rather than a wish list.  

No vague adjectives. No generic templates. Each specification defines a unique **Organizational Stage**, its **management–leadership–stewardship mix**, and the corresponding expression of [the DOES Leadership Model](https://josejruiz.com/leadership-folder/introduction-to-the-does-leadership-model/). Leadership is always contextual, and effectiveness emerges only when capability, complexity, and contribution align.

## Preparing to Launch a Search

Before beginning any search, leadership teams should answer three critical questions:

1. What **Organizational Stage** are we in, and what evidence supports it?  
2. What **balance of management, leadership, and stewardship** do we require for success over the next horizon?  
3. Which **dimensions of the DOES Leadership Model** must dominate to create the desired outcomes?

If you can answer those questions clearly, your search will move with speed and purpose. If not, that is the right place to begin. Clarity at the start is not a delay—it is the shortest path to the right leader.

## Conclusion: Leadership as Organizational Design

Executive Search, CEO Executive Search, and Board Member Search are not merely about finding talent—they are acts of **organizational design**.  

When you define your **Organizational Stage**, balance your **management, leadership, and stewardship** requirements, and articulate the leadership work through [the DOES Leadership Model](https://josejruiz.com/leadership-folder/introduction-to-the-does-leadership-model/), you do far more than fill a position. You align judgment with context. You strengthen institutional coherence. You build a system where meaningful work and sustained performance can thrive.  

That is the purpose of search—and it is the standard I hold for every engagement.
