## Excerpt
[Executive search](https://josejruiz.com/recruitment/) succeeds when it matches the contribution a role truly requires with the contribution a leader can reliably make. This paper operationalizes that match by applying “[Bands of Contribution](https://josejruiz.com/leadership-folder/contribution-bands-cb6-present-future-enduring/)”—a practical synthesis of Levels of Work and [the DOES model](https://josejruiz.com/leadership-folder/introduction-to-the-does-leadership-model/)—to position definition, candidate targeting, and the disciplined sequence of assessment, evaluation, and appreciation.

## Abstract
This concept paper proposes a contribution-centered method for executive search. It defines “[Bands of Contribution](https://josejruiz.com/leadership-folder/contribution-bands-cb6-present-future-enduring/)” as discrete patterns of value creation mapped to increasing complexity and time span (Levels of Work) and articulated through the cyclical disciplines of Design, Organize, Execute, and Sustain (DOES). It then applies these bands to three pivotal search phases: first, position definition grounded in decision complexity, time horizon, and guardrails of success; second, candidate targeting guided by indicators of current and potential capability; and third, a rigorous differentiation of assessment, evaluation, and appreciation as distinct leadership disciplines that together create clarity, accountability, and trust. The approach links organizational mandate to leadership judgment, reduces mismatch risk, and produces durable placements by aligning how value is created with what the institution genuinely needs.

## Introduction
[Executive search ](https://josejruiz.com/executive-search-insights/)is often framed as finding a person for a job. In complex systems, it is better understood as aligning a **pattern of contribution** with a **pattern of demand** across time. Contribution is not merely a list of tasks; it is the quality of judgment, design, integration, execution, and renewal a leader brings to a role’s context. Demand is not merely a requisition; it is the mix of complexity, horizon, and boundaries that a system needs a leader to hold.

To make this alignment explicit, this paper uses **Bands of Contribution**—a search-ready construct that groups roles by the kind of value they must create and the time span over which they must sustain it. The bands are derived from increasing **Levels of Work** and expressed through **DOES** as four interdependent fields of practice that translate vision to structure, structure to action, and action to renewal. When search starts from contribution rather than title, organizations gain a coherent line of sight from mandate to decision, and from decision to hire.

## Defining the Bands of Contribution
The Bands of Contribution segment roles by their **dominant pattern of value creation** and **time horizon**. They translate the abstract ladder of complexity into a practical lexicon for search and selection.

### Execute
The Execute band emphasizes dependable delivery within short feedback cycles. Leaders in this band ensure outcomes through disciplined planning, resource management, and direct problem-solving. Complexity is constrained; ambiguity is present but limited; time horizons are typically quarters rather than years.

### Organize
The Organize band integrates across functions to build capacity and coherence. Leaders design operating models, orchestrate cross-functional coordination, and manage interdependencies. Complexity arises from scale and interfaces; horizons expand to one to three years; the work centers on creating repeatability and reliability at scope.

### Design
The Design band shapes direction under uncertainty. Leaders here stabilize meaning, frame choices, and convert ambiguity into coherent strategy and portfolios. They hold longer horizons, integrate external signals, and accept that decisions must be revisited as conditions evolve. The emphasis is on defining the game, not just playing it well.

### Sustain
The Sustain band embeds long-view stewardship—renewal, resilience, leadership pipelines, and responsibility—so the institution endures. These leaders treat the enterprise as a living system, aligning purpose, governance, risk, and culture over multi-year horizons. They maintain the conditions under which Design, Organize, and Execute can continue to perform.

Bands are not job grades or personality types. They are **decision postures** tied to the complexity of the system and the length of time a leader must hold consequences. A role can lean into one band and still draw on others; the point is to clarify which pattern must dominate for success.

## Position Definition Through Bands of Contribution
Position definition is the decisive act in search. Rather than starting with a generic title and task list, define the role by the **contribution band** it must occupy, the **horizon** it must reliably hold, the **decision context** it will face, and the **guardrails** within which it must deliver.

### Name the Dominant Field of Practice
Begin by clarifying whether the role is primarily **Design**, **Organize**, **Execute**, or **Sustain**. For example, a Chief Strategy Officer typically occupies a Design-dominant band; a Chief Operating Officer leans Organize-dominant; a turnaround CEO often straddles Design and Execute. Naming the dominant field prevents the common failure mode of hiring superb operators into design-heavy roles or visionary strategists into organize-heavy roles.

### Specify the Management Horizon
Define the time span the leader must hold without immediate feedback. Is the role accountable for quarter-by-quarter delivery, for a two-year operating model, for a three- to five-year strategy, or for multi-year institutional stewardship? The horizon calibrates the judgment required and influences both sourcing and interview architecture.

### Map the Decision Mosaic
Describe the **decision conditions** the leader will face: What is known versus unknown? Which choices are reversible, and at what cost? Where will decisions be made in complicated environments (analyzable, expert-led) versus complex ones (emergent, probe-and-learn)? This moves the brief beyond competencies to the **judgment substrate** of the job.

### State Outcomes and Guardrails
Define success as a **shared narrative** with measurable outcomes, then codify **guardrails** that protect freedom to operate. Guardrails can include capital efficiency thresholds, leverage limits, regulatory posture, brand constraints, and risk appetite. Outcomes and guardrails together become the evaluation anchor for both the role and the eventual hire.

### Fit to Organizational Stage and Capacity
Finally, consider the organization’s **stage of development** and the difference between **capability** (a leader’s strength at a given complexity) and **capacity** (the system’s scale and resourcing). A leader may be fully capable while the institution lacks the capacity to support that contribution—or vice versa. Stating stage and capacity explicitly reduces downstream mismatch.

## Candidate Targeting With Bands of Contribution
With the position definition grounded in a band, targeting shifts from job titles to **patterns of contribution** evidenced over time.

### Distinguish Current from Potential Capability
Differentiate between a candidate’s **current operating level** and their **potential to operate at longer horizons**. Targeting should consider how the candidate reasons about complexity today and whether their growth trajectory aligns with the role’s horizon. This avoids confusing history with headroom and reduces the risk of both over- and under-leveling.

### Seek Evidence of Judgment in Context
For Design-dominant roles, probe how candidates stabilized meaning in ambiguous contexts, reframed problems, and translated intent into coherent portfolios. For Organize-dominant roles, look for the creation of cross-functional capacity, operating rhythm, and systems reliability. For Execute-dominant roles, emphasize disciplined delivery under pressure and rapid feedback loops. For Sustain-dominant roles, examine how leaders built renewal, resilience, and leadership pipelines—not as side projects but as embedded practice.

### Align to Stage-Specific Demand Signals
Early-stage enterprises often need leaders whose contribution skews toward design and decisive execution under ambiguity. Later-stage organizations may require leaders who excel at organizing at scale or sustaining institutional coherence. Treat stage as a demand signal rather than a cultural stereotype; what matters is the **fit between contribution and context**.

### Ensure Mandate Compatibility
Anchor targeting in the organization’s **mandate**—the agreed outcomes and guardrails. Candidates who cannot operate within these boundaries will either underperform or generate misalignment, regardless of personal brilliance. The search brief should surface mandate compatibility early to preserve time and trust.

## Assessment, Evaluation, and Appreciation
Contribution-centered search depends on a **disciplined sequence** of three distinct practices. Confusing them erodes trust and leads to poor decisions; practicing them coherently yields clarity and momentum.

### Assessment: Structured Sense-Making
**Assessment** is diagnostic. Its purpose is to understand *how* a candidate thinks, *how* they have matched contribution to context, and *what* patterns emerge across time. Techniques include structured, evidence-seeking interviews; work-sample explorations that reveal decision logic; and reference conversations focused on judgment under analogous conditions. Assessment belongs to **sense-making**, not verdicts. It maps the territory without declaring winners.

### Evaluation: Judgment Against Standards
**Evaluation** introduces judgment. It compares the assessed patterns to the brief’s **standards**—outcomes, horizon, decision conditions, and guardrails—to determine sufficiency and fit. Evaluation integrates **capability**, **ability**, and **capacity**: Can the leader hold the horizon, make decisions at the required complexity, and deliver within the system’s real constraints? Evaluation should be conducted as a **separate moment** from assessment to preserve clarity and reduce bias.

### Appreciation: Recognition That Sustains Energy
**Appreciation** is relational and non-comparative. It acknowledges effort and presence in the process, maintains dignity for candidates, and strengthens trust with stakeholders—even when outcomes diverge from expectations. Practiced alongside disciplined assessment and evaluation, appreciation sustains energy and coherence in the search ecosystem. It is not about softening a “no”; it is about stewarding relationships and reputation in a finite talent market.

## A Practical Workflow for Contribution-Centered Search
A banded workflow keeps the search coherent from brief to decision.

### 1) Codify the Band and Horizon
Name the dominant DOES field and the management horizon. Translate this into a one-page **search thesis** that also captures stage, capacity, and guardrails. This becomes the north star for sourcing, interviews, references, and deliberations.

### 2) Translate the Thesis into Target Profiles
Construct target profiles anchored in contribution patterns rather than titles. Define the **signals of judgment** you expect to observe in résumés, case narratives, and references. Clarify what would constitute **disqualifying evidence** (e.g., repeated difficulty holding a multi-year horizon, or success only in tightly bounded, short-cycle roles when the new role is design-dominant).

### 3) Run Assessment as Inquiry
Design the interview loop to elicit **reasoning, reframing, and integration**. Use consistent prompts that mirror the decision mosaic in the brief. Treat references as **hypothesis testing**: you are seeking corroboration (or refutation) of the candidate’s pattern of contribution, not personality endorsements.

### 4) Deliberate Evaluation Separately
Hold a structured evaluation meeting that explicitly maps candidate evidence to the band, horizon, outcomes, and guardrails. Require participants to state the decision standard they are using (“For a three-year horizon in a complex, emergent market, I saw consistent design-level framing and portfolio translation”). This discipline reduces the tendency to drift into vague preferences or competency scorecards detached from the actual mandate.

### 5) Close with Appreciation and Onboarding Guardrails
Conclude with appreciation for candidates and clarity for the selected leader. Convert the search thesis into **onboarding guardrails**: explicit early outcomes, decision rights, operating rhythms, and stakeholder map. This ensures the promised contribution has the conditions to appear.

## Illustrative Role Patterns
While every organization is unique, certain role archetypes often align with particular bands:

### Chief Operating Officer (Organize-Dominant)
The COO’s value is realized by converting strategy into capacity. Indicators include building cross-functional cadences, designing metrics that expose interdependencies, and institutionalizing improvement routines. The horizon is typically one to three years, with strong feedback loops from operational data.

### Chief Strategy Officer (Design-Dominant)
The CSO translates uncertainty into strategic portfolios and learning agendas. Indicators include reframing industry shifts, defining option spaces, and designing stage-gates for investment. The horizon extends three or more years, with a premium on pattern recognition and iterative decision-making.

### Turnaround CEO (Design + Execute)
This role demands simultaneous reframing and decisive action. Indicators include rapid problem scoping, stabilizing liquidity and morale, and sequencing initiatives that buy time while redesigning the game. The horizon may start short to arrest decline, then lengthen as strategic options open.

### Stewardship-Oriented Board Chair (Sustain-Dominant)
The Chair sustains institutional coherence and long-term legitimacy. Indicators include shaping mandate clarity with management, calibrating risk appetite, ensuring leadership pipelines, and aligning governance with purpose. The horizon spans multiple cycles; contribution is measured in enduring capacity, not quarterly outputs.

## Why Bands of Contribution Improve Search Outcomes
Contribution bands surface **cognitive fit** and **systemic fit** simultaneously. They keep the brief anchored in **how** value must be created over time, not just **what** tasks will be performed. They provide a shared vocabulary for boards, CEOs, and search partners, reducing ambiguity and accelerating decision-making. Critically, bands help prevent two costly errors: placing high-skill operators into design-heavy roles, and placing visionary strategists into organize-heavy roles. By focusing on horizon, decision posture, outcomes, and guardrails, bands convert the fuzziness of “fit” into an explicit, testable thesis.

Bands also connect search to the **progression of meaningful response**—sense-making, meaning-making, framing, and solving. In practice, this means you are selecting not merely for experience, but for the **structure of judgment** a leader uses to define problems, design responses, and deliver outcomes within agreed boundaries. When measurement and mandate are explicit, interviews become more revealing, references more objective, and deliberations less prone to bias.

## Conclusion
Executive search is a design problem masquerading as a hiring problem. The organization must design a role as a contribution band with an explicit horizon, decision context, outcomes, and guardrails. The search team must design targeting to discover capability and stage fit, distinguishing present operating level from potential. And the hiring institution must design its feedback disciplines so that **assessment** informs, **evaluation** decides, and **appreciation** dignifies.

When these elements are made explicit and practiced coherently, the result is more than a successful hire. It is an alignment of contribution and demand that compounds over time—strategy translated into structure, structure into execution, and execution into sustained relevance. That is the deeper promise of applying Bands of Contribution to executive search: leaders placed not merely into jobs, but into roles where their judgment can create enduring value within clear, trusted boundaries.
