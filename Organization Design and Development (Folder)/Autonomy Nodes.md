# Autonomy Nodes: Bounded Autonomy, Trust-Based Authorization, and the Tripod of Work

## Excerpt
Autonomy Nodes are deliberate, bounded spaces of work that make promises explicit and confer **trust-based authorization** to use **judgment and discretion** while people are **tasked, trusted, and tended**. Horizontally, nodes connect through **SIPOC—Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers**—so one node’s customer becomes the next node’s supplier. Vertically, nodes connect at borders: the **border of escalation** for one node is the **border of delegation** for the node above. Held together by the **Tripod of Work**—tasking, trusting, and tending—these seams create flow, align responsibility with capability, and keep the system humane and effective.

## Abstract
This paper formalizes Autonomy Nodes as the smallest auditable unit of distributed accountability inside an organization and integrates Gillian Stamp’s **Tripod of Work** as the node’s internal discipline. Externally, a node is defined by **SIPOC (Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers)** so that upstream and downstream promises are legible and measurable. Internally, a node is governed by the Tripod of Work: **tasking** (defining outcomes and limits), **trusting** (delegating judgment and discretion), and **tending** (maintaining relevance, context, and support). These disciplines balance challenge and capability, reducing the “misuse” of people (overstretch beyond capability) and “disuse” (under-challenge that wastes capability). Vertically, the **border of delegation** specifies what can be passed downward while remaining accountable; the **border of escalation** specifies when matters must move upward because risk, scope, or implications exceed the mandate. When one node’s escalation border meets the next node’s delegation border, the seam of judgment is clean and fast. The result is principled speed and sustained flow: decisions happen where knowledge is freshest, learning returns where it can improve the next call, and the organization compounds performance and integrity.

## Introduction
Organizations often falter at the seams—where a handoff crosses a team boundary or where judgment must move between levels. Calls for “more autonomy” rarely help if autonomy is left for people to improvise. **Autonomy Nodes** address this by clarifying two interfaces at once. Along the value chain, **SIPOC (Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers)** states the promises that travel with work. Along the hierarchy, borders clarify the shift in judgment and risk between levels. Inside the node, **the Tripod of Work**—tasking, trusting, and tending—turns autonomy from a slogan into practiced responsibility. When these elements align, people exercise **judgment and discretion** with confidence, because they are explicitly **tasked, trusted, and tended**.

---

## Canonical Foundations: The Tripod of Work
**Origins and intent.** Developed by Gillian Stamp within the Bioss tradition, the Tripod of Work explains how responsibility is conferred, supported, and contained. It responds to two failure states that damage both people and organizations: **misuse** (challenges that significantly exceed current capability) and **disuse** (challenges that fall below it). The tripod’s purpose is to create the conditions for good work—psychological flow, sound judgment, and sustainable performance—by balancing three interdependent disciplines.

**Tasking—defining outcomes and limits.** Tasking is a disciplined conversation that clarifies outputs, quality parameters, cost constraints, and time frames. It anchors what “good” looks like and what must not be violated. Effective tasking sets **boundaries and expectations** without scripting method; it states completion time, degree of discretion, and conditions for review.

**Trusting—delegating judgment and discretion.** Trusting is not a vague feeling; it is **trust-based authorization**: a conscious design of **which decisions** may be taken independently, which require consultation, and which must be escalated. Trust is commensurate with capability and mandate, so people are neither constrained to mechanical execution (disuse) nor exposed to risk they cannot carry (misuse).

**Tending—maintaining relevance, context, and support.** Tending is the ongoing care of work, context, and the person doing it. It monitors without crowding, updates priorities as conditions shift, and keeps the narrative of purpose alive. Tending preserves ethics and relationships while ensuring that learning returns to the place where it will improve the next judgment.

**Optimal and distorted forms.** Held in balance, the tripod yields flow: clear ends (tasking), owned judgment (trusting), and living context (tending). Distortions are predictable. A **rigid tripod** hardens tasking into enforcing, collapses trusting into distrust, and mutates tending into policing. A **diffuse tripod** lets tasking degrade into handing-over, trusting dissolve into over-trust or abdication, and tending evaporate into neglect. Many stable, safety-critical settings use a **tripod of continuity**—tight tasking, experience-based trusting, administrative tending—which is appropriate until adaptation is required; then, the tripod must be consciously rebalanced.

---

## Defining the Autonomy Node
An **Autonomy Node** is a bounded unit of purpose, authority, and accountability that owns a coherent slice of value creation. It is characterized by:

1. **External Contract (SIPOC).** A SIPOC canvas that names Suppliers and the Inputs they commit to provide; makes the Process explicit; defines Outputs in terms of fitness-for-use; and identifies Customers who receive those outputs. This converts handoffs from hope into promise and makes measures discussable.

2. **Internal Discipline (Tripod of Work).**  
   - **Tasking:** a crisp mandate and permitted trade-offs.  
   - **Trusting:** **trust-based authorization** to use **judgment and discretion** within explicit decision rights and visibility.  
   - **Tending:** the care of people, interfaces, and learning routines, so autonomy strengthens rather than frays collaboration.

3. **Vertical Borders.** A decision charter that describes owned decisions, consultation points, and thresholds that cross the **border of escalation**; alignment so that the receiving level’s **border of delegation** meets that escalation border cleanly.

4. **Competence Fit.** Roles and mandates matched to the **Domains of Competence**—**ability** (demonstrable skill), **capability** (judgment for handling complexity across time), and **capacity** (the scalable breadth and volume of work).

---

## Horizontal Connection: Value Chain to Chain of Nodes
Following the value chain reveals a sequence of nodes linked by **SIPOC—Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers**. Because **one node’s customer becomes the next node’s supplier**, promises and measures travel with the work. When a mismatch appears, the first question is structural, not personal: Was the input ambiguous? Was fitness-for-use poorly specified? Did the process change without updating the promise? This framing turns disagreement into teachable improvement and reduces political friction at boundaries.

---

## Vertical Connection: Borders That Meet Cleanly
Judgment also moves vertically. The **border of delegation** states what a role holder is expected and authorized to pass downward while remaining accountable. The **border of escalation** names when an issue must be transferred upward because its risk, scope, or irreversibility exceed the mandate. The two borders interlock: **one node’s escalation border is the next node’s delegation border**. When the seam is explicit, issues rise with context, options, and a recommendation; decisions descend with authority, scope, and updated constraints. When the seam is vague, issues ping-pong, ownership blurs, and leaders drown in decisions that do not match their level of concern.

---

## The Space of Autonomy: Judgment and Discretion, Tasked-Trusted-Tended
The **Space of Autonomy** is the lived territory where people are **tasked, trusted, and tended** to use **judgment and discretion**. Four elements give this space practical force:

1. **Outcomes.** A small set of results and quality criteria expresses what “good” looks like.  
2. **Trade-off Rules.** Permitted exchange rates among cost, speed, scope, and risk make implicit judgments explicit.  
3. **Decision Thresholds.** Quantitative and qualitative limits clarify which decisions sit locally and which cross the escalation border—e.g., exposure beyond a set amount, regulatory implications, irreversible commitments, or cross-node dependencies.  
4. **Telemetry.** Leading and lagging signals make decisions observable in real time, coupling trust to visibility rather than supervision.

Adjusting thresholds and visibility expands or narrows the space without undermining confidence. Expansions are earned through demonstrated ability, growing capability, and sustained capacity; contractions are protective responses to volatility or signal drift and are framed as system changes, not personal blame.

---

## How the Tripod Powers the Node
- **Tasking stabilizes ends.** Clear outcomes and limits keep energy focused and reduce diffusion.  
- **Trusting stabilizes judgment.** Trust-based authorization turns decision rights into a routine, not an exception—people know what they can call and what they must elevate.  
- **Tending stabilizes relevance.** Boundary rituals—supplier–customer dialogues, cadence reviews, after-action reflections—keep interfaces healthy, ethics visible, and learning continuous.

Together, these disciplines counter **misuse** and **disuse**. Tasking matches challenge to mandate, trusting aligns discretion to capability, and tending keeps the match current as conditions shift.

---

## Suboptimal Patterns at Node Scale—and Their Remedies
- **Rigid Node (enforcing, distrust, policing).** Symptoms: slow decisions, initiative withers, reviews accumulate without action. *Remedy:* loosen tasking into clear ends with options, convert surveillance into telemetry, and specify trusted decisions explicitly.  
- **Diffuse Node (handing-over, over-trust/abdication, neglect).** Symptoms: guesswork, variable quality, conflict at boundaries. *Remedy:* sharpen outcomes and limits, re-authoritize concrete decision classes, reinstate tending rituals.  
- **Continuity-Bound Node (stability first).** Useful in safety-critical contexts but becomes brittle in change. *Remedy:* consciously broaden trusted decision classes and rehearse escalation frames before volatility arrives.

---

## Decision Flow Across Nodes
Healthy decision flow depends on the horizontal and vertical couplings working together. As outputs cross a SIPOC boundary, the receiving node exercises authorized **judgment and discretion** inside its Space of Autonomy. If a local decision would alter upstream feasibility or downstream commitments, the escalation border ensures the matter rises to the level where cross-node trade-offs belong; the matching delegation border ensures a timely, well-held decision, which is then re-delegated with updated constraints. In this way, a **ladder of judgment** mirrors the **chain of value**, preventing local optimization from injuring the whole.

---

## Calibrating Fit with the Domains of Competence
Delegation, escalation, and the scope of trusted decisions are calibrated to the **Domains of Competence**:
- **Ability** secures today’s execution quality.  
- **Capability** holds increasing complexity and longer consequences with sound judgment.  
- **Capacity** ensures the system can carry the breadth and volume of work without hidden queues.

When domains and mandate align, the right decisions are made at the right level. When they misalign, the system either hoards decisions above or pushes them below readiness. The corrective is to adjust staffing, coaching, and decision charters—not to add ad hoc approvals.

---

## Governance as Trust-Based Authorization
Governance sustains autonomy by keeping decisions observable and responsibilities explicit. Three anchors are sufficient and scalable:
1. **SIPOC promises** are verifiable at boundaries.  
2. **Decision charters** codify decision rights, thresholds, and escalation triggers—turning trust into structure.  
3. **Cadenced reviews** examine decision quality and escalation health (latency, framing completeness, rework trend) so borders and competencies are adjusted with evidence.

The governing posture is simple: people are **tasked, trusted, and tended** to use **judgment and discretion**; the system ensures their decisions are visible and their promises are kept.

---

## Implementation Path
1. **Map a value stream** and identify natural nodes.  
2. **Draft a SIPOC canvas** for each node: Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers; include measures and cadence.  
3. **Write the decision charter**: owned decisions, consult points, escalation thresholds, telemetry.  
4. **Rehearse the seam** where the lower node’s escalation border meets the upper node’s delegation border—agree framing, turnaround, and re-delegation patterns.  
5. **Embed Tripod rituals**: weekly tasking refresh, trusted-decision review, boundary tending with upstream/downstream partners.  
6. **Inspect and adapt** using decision latency, defect containment at boundaries, and the proportion of escalations resolved at the first receiving level.

---

## Conclusion
Autonomy Nodes translate strategy into distributed accountability by aligning three essentials. **SIPOC (Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers)** ties nodes into a chain of explicit promises. The **border of escalation** and **border of delegation** meet vertically to form a clean seam of judgment. Inside the boundary, Gillian Stamp’s **Tripod of Work—tasking, trusting, tending**—confers **trust-based authorization** to use **judgment and discretion** while keeping people, interfaces, and learning healthy. Calibrated by the **Domains of Competence** and disciplined by simple governance, this design yields principled speed: decisions happen where knowledge is freshest, learning returns to where it will improve the next call, and the organization compounds both performance and integrity.
