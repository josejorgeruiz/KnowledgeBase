## Abstract

This article formalizes a six-stage framework of organizational development—Stage 0 (“Zero-to-One”) through Stage 5 (“Adaptive Renewal/Excellence”)—drawn from and aligned with the Canonical Concepts & Constructs and the General Glossary of Terms. The stages describe a migration of the locus of capability from individuals to institutions and the corresponding evolution of leadership practice through the **DOES** cycle (Design, Organize, Execute, Sustain). I integrate adjacent research—including Greiner’s phases and crises, Churchill & Lewis’s small-business stages, Adizes’s corporate lifecycle, and dynamic-capabilities theory—to justify stage transitions and failure modes. The paper distinguishes **capability** from **ability** and **capacity** and clarifies the dependency of **individual capacity** on **organizational capability** and structures. The result is a conceptual foundation for stage-specific diagnostics, leadership development, and operating-model design that can be tested empirically and operationalized in practice.

## Introduction

Organizations do not merely grow; they **change form**. Across their journey, they repeatedly encounter thresholds where the prior coordinating mechanism becomes a constraint, triggering a qualitative shift in structure, leadership, and learning. The **Organizational Stages** in the canonical glossary define this developmental trajectory from inception to adaptive maturity and supply the vocabulary used here for definitional precision and systemic alignment.  

This paper has three aims. First, to **anchor the six stages** (Stage 0 plus Stages 1–5) in canonical definition and purpose. Second, to integrate **individual capability** and **organizational capability**—and their relationship to **ability** and **capacity**—as the underlying developmental logic. Third, to show how the **DOES Leadership Model** shifts emphasis across stages, converting strategy into structure, structure into execution, and execution into renewal.

## Foundations: Capability, Ability, and Capacity

### Capability and Ability

**Capability** denotes the capacity to handle increasing complexity across time horizons—how individuals and organizations **anticipate, decide, and adapt**—distinct from **ability**, which is present-tense, skill-based know-how applied within known conditions.   

At the **individual** level, capability reflects judgment and sense-making under ambiguity; it is shaped by experience and governs potential for higher levels of work. At the **organizational** level, capability is the system’s resilience—its governance, processes, and culture that enable coherent sense- and meaning-making beyond any single person. 
### Capacity and Its Dependency

**Capacity** concerns **scale, scope, and volume**—how broadly ability and capability can be applied across teams and timeframes. Critically, **individual capacity** is **relational**: it cannot be sustained without the scaffolding of **organizational capacity** (resources, roles, cadence, tooling). Thus, even extraordinary individuals cannot sustain high throughput in the absence of enabling structures; conversely, robust systems can multiply average individual performance.  
### Cognitive Underpinning

The developmental link between people and structure is illuminated by **Stratified Systems Theory** and Gillian Stamp’s **Mode of Thinking**, which align individual potential capability with levels of work and time span. This alignment explains why mis-matches (e.g., complex roles staffed with purely serial thinkers) degrade execution and learning.

## The Six Organizational Stages

### Stage 0 — Zero-to-One (Visionary Genesis)

#### Definition and Purpose
Stage 0 is the leap from non-existence to **novel value**: the founder articulates a contrarian thesis, discovers problem–solution fit, and produces a first instantiation of something meaningfully **new** rather than incrementally better. Canonically, creation begins with belief and drive before formal systems exist. 
#### Justification and Adjacent Scholarship
Thiel’s “Zero to One” sharpens the distinction between **vertical progress** (0→1 novelty) and **horizontal progress** (1→n replication), clarifying why Stage 0 is categorically different from scaling stages.  
#### Capability, Ability, and Capacity
Capability is intensely **individual**; ability is artisanal craft and hustle; capacity is limited by cash and founder bandwidth. Without rudimentary organizational capability, **individual capacity** will exhaust quickly—highlighting early needs for cadence and minimal structure.  
#### DOES Emphasis
**Design** dominates (hypothesis generation, framing), **Execute** is hands-on, **Organize** is intentionally light, and **Sustain** focuses on resilience habits and cash discipline.  

---
### Stage 1 — Early Framework

#### Definition and Purpose
Basic roles and processes appear; personal effort becomes an initial organizational form. The locus of capability remains with the founder, but **repeatability** emerges.  
#### Justification and Adjacent Scholarship
Greiner’s early “creativity” phase ends in a **crisis of leadership**, where a single overseer can no longer coordinate everything—propelling the shift toward direction and basic management.  
#### Capability, Ability, and Capacity
Individual capability is still the primary driver; **organizational capability** appears as simple routines and metrics. Individual capacity expands only as organizational capacity (people, rhythm, tooling) grows.  
#### DOES Emphasis
**Execute** and **Design** remain prominent; **Organize** introduces clarity of roles and basic cadence; **Sustain** is reactive but intentional (after-action reviews, founder self-care).  

---
### Stage 2 — Growth Acceleration

#### Definition and Purpose
Demand outpaces structure; coordination becomes the constraint. Stronger prioritization and formalization are required to **sustain** growth. 
#### Justification and Adjacent Scholarship
Churchill & Lewis’s model shows the owner’s role shifting from doer to **manager**, while Greiner predicts a crisis of direction giving way to **delegation** and planning. 
#### Capability, Ability, and Capacity
**Organizational capability** begins to **substitute** for individual heroics via SOPs and basic governance. This substitution is multiplicative: it raises **organizational capacity**, allowing more work at higher reliability with the same talent.
#### DOES Emphasis
**Organize** rises (resource management, talent alignment, communication), **Execute** becomes process-based, **Design** shifts to roadmaps, and **Sustain** formalizes reviews and compliance.  

---
### Stage 3 — Operational Maturity

#### Definition and Purpose
Execution stabilizes; management layers, accountability, and empowered teams replace heroics with **reliable, repeatable performance**. 
#### Justification and Adjacent Scholarship
Greiner anticipates a **crisis of coordination** as silos form; the remedy is integrative mechanisms and planning disciplines that align end-to-end value streams.
#### Capability, Ability, and Capacity
Organizational capability—now embodied in cross-functional governance and shared methods—drives throughput. Individual capacity expands through **system fluency** more than raw skill, as roles require navigation across interdependencies. 
#### DOES Emphasis
**Design** becomes system design (operating models), **Organize** orchestrates cross-functional work, **Execute** emphasizes cycle time and quality, **Sustain** institutionalizes continuous improvement and knowledge management. 

---
### Stage 4 — Strategic Coherence

#### Definition and Purpose
Leadership aligns **vision, systems, and accountability**; strategy integrates foresight, ethics, and risk into a coherent direction across portfolios, geographies, or platforms.  
#### Justification and Adjacent Scholarship
**Dynamic-capabilities** research explains performance advantages where firms can **sense**, **seize**, and **reconfigure**—organizational capabilities that must be embedded beyond any individual. 
#### Capability, Ability, and Capacity
Enterprise capability becomes the **dominant** performance driver; individual capacity scales through roles that allocate resources, orchestrate talent markets, and shape culture. This is where **organizational capacity** (scope, scale, volume) most visibly multiplies outcomes.  
#### DOES Emphasis
**Design** becomes strategy-as-learning; **Organize** links strategy to resource orchestration and culture building; **Execute** balances scale efficiency with local responsiveness; **Sustain** emphasizes resilience, risk ethics, and leadership pipelines. 

---

### Stage 5 — Adaptive Renewal (Institutionalized Excellence)

#### Definition and Purpose
Learning and agility define success; the organization continually **evolves**, balancing stability with innovation to sustain long-term relevance and performance. 
#### Justification and Adjacent Scholarship
Adizes warns of the slide from **Prime** into bureaucratic decline; sustained excellence requires renewal systems that protect identity while refreshing strategy and design. **Dynamic-capabilities** again provide the microfoundations for persistent advantage.  
#### Capability, Ability, and Capacity
Capability is now **institutional**: values, culture, governance, and routines carry adaptation forward. Individual capacity expresses through stewardship—shaping future conditions, not merely operating within present ones.  
#### DOES Emphasis
**Sustain** becomes generative (foresight, innovation leadership, resilience, change, sustainability), while **Design** curates long-horizon bets, **Organize** keeps the architecture adaptive, and **Execute** remains world-class through continuous learning.

## Justifying Stage Boundaries with Adjacent Scholarship

### Evolution–Revolution Dynamics
Greiner’s cross-industry synthesis demonstrates that growth proceeds through **evolutionary periods** punctuated by predictable **crises** (leadership, autonomy/direction, coordination, bureaucracy), each requiring a new managerial logic. This empirical pattern undergirds the step-changes described in Stages 1–5.  
### Small-Business Progression and the Owner’s Role
Churchill & Lewis show how the owner’s role evolves from hands-on operator to strategic manager, mirroring the migration of capability from person to system central to Stage 1→3 transitions.  
### Liecycle Risks and Renewal
Adizes’s lifecycle identifies **Prime** as the delicate balance of flexibility and control; without explicit renewal (Stage 5), organizations drift into aristocracy and decline—clarifying the necessity of **Sustain** at advanced stages. 
### Microfoundations of Renewal
Dynamic-capabilities theory provides the **how** of Stage 4–5: firms outperform when they routinize **sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring** amid change—capabilities that are, by design, **organizational**, not merely individual.
### The Uniqueness of Stage 0
“Zero-to-One” clarifies that Stage 0 pursues vertical progress—non-incremental novelty—requiring Design-heavy leadership and minimal structure until repeatability emerges.

## How DOES Leadership Evolves by Stage

### Rebalancing the Cycle

The **DOES Leadership Model** is universal—expressed at every level and horizon—but its **relative emphasis** shifts with stage complexity. In early stages, Design and Execute dominate; mid-stages elevate Organize to convert ingenuity into throughput; advanced stages privilege Sustain to embed renewal, ethics, and resilience. 
### Stage-Specific Expressions

#### Stage 0–1
Design frames contrarian theses and product learning; Execute is founder-led craft; Organize installs only the lightest scaffolding; Sustain preserves founder energy and cash runway.  
#### Stage 2
Organize formalizes roles, budgets, and cross-functional collaboration so that ability scales; Sustain adds governance cadence; Design becomes roadmap-driven. 
#### Stage 3
Design operates at system level; Organize coordinates across functions; Execute targets reliability and cycle time; Sustain institutionalizes continuous improvement and knowledge systems. 
#### Stage 4–5
Design becomes strategy-as-learning and optioncraft; Organize orchestrates portfolios and culture; Execute balances scale with local context; Sustain stewards identity, resilience, leadership development, change, and sustainability thinking.

## Implications and Propositions for Further Work

### Diagnostic Implications
Stage diagnosis should assess the **dominant constraint** (e.g., coordination vs. agility), the **current DOES balance**, and the **capability mix** (individual vs. organizational). Canonical definitions make this assessment coherent across engagements.
### Propositions

#### P1 — Crisis-Capability Fit
Organizations advance stages when the prevailing coordinating mechanism fails to resolve the core constraint, necessitating a different DOES balance; this is consistent with Greiner’s evolution–revolution dynamic. 
#### P2 — Embedding Gradient
From Stage 2 onward, the share of performance variance explained by **organizational capability** increases monotonically; by Stage 5, dynamic capabilities are primarily institutional. 
#### P3 — Capacity Is Relational
**Individual capacity** cannot be sustained without **organizational capacity**; measured improvements in throughput under constant headcount should track investments in structure, cadence, and tooling. 
#### P4 — Cognitive–Role Alignment
Alignment between **Mode of Thinking** (potential capability) and **Level of Work** predicts performance at stage transitions; mis-matches degrade quality and increase cycle time.  
#### P5 — Stewardship as a Safeguard
Without **Sustain** disciplines, organizations at Stage 4 will drift; stewardship practices preserve identity while enabling renewal.

## Conclusion

Progress from Zero-to-One to Adaptive Excellence is not a straight line of scale; it is a **sequence of form changes**. Each stage reassigns the work of leadership across DOES, gradually relocating capability from exceptional people to resilient systems. Distinguishing capability, ability, and capacity—and recognizing the dependency of individual capacity on organizational capability—equips leaders to design the **next form** before crisis compels it. This staged lens provides a researchable map for diagnostics, development, and operating-model design across the Management Horizon.
