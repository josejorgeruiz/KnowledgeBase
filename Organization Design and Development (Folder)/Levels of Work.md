## Excerpt  
Clarity about the level at which work is done prevents two costly errors—assigning people to roles that ask for more judgment than they can hold, and designing roles that demand less judgment than the system requires. Levels of Work offer a neutral language for calibrating complexity, time span, and accountability so talent, structure, and strategy align.

## Abstract  
Levels of Work define the hierarchy of complexity in organizations by specifying the scale, scope, and **time span of discretion** expected at each layer of contribution. The construct emerged from **Elliott Jaques’s** Stratified Systems Theory, which demonstrated that effective organizations differentiate roles by the length of time over which judgment must be exercised to deliver results. **Gillian Stamp** advanced the practice through the **Mode of Thinking** model and **Career Path Appreciation (CPA)**, providing disciplined ways to appreciate current and emerging capability and to align individuals with roles that match the complexity they can hold.

This paper introduces the logic of Levels of Work; clarifies relationships among **capability** (judgment across time), **ability** (present skill), and **capacity** (scale and scope of application); outlines the entry levels and transitional thresholds; and shows how to apply the construct to role design, succession, and governance. The intent is a shared language that enables coherent organizational design and humane talent decisions.

## Introduction  
Complexity, not status, is the organizing principle of modern work. Work that differs in uncertainty, interdependence, and horizon cannot be coordinated with a single logic of supervision or a single vocabulary of performance. Levels of Work name discrete bands of complexity and their corresponding time spans so that judgment requirements in roles are explicit and people are asked to exercise judgment at a level they can reliably sustain.

Jaques established the theoretical spine: roles differ primarily by **time span of discretion**—the length of time a role holder must hold uncertainty before results can be meaningfully evaluated. Stamp extended this with a developmental account of how people think at increasing levels of complexity (Mode of Thinking) and with an assessment practice (CPA) that appreciates emerging capability over time. Together, these contributions connect structure with human development in a way that is rigorous and humane.

## Foundational Vocabulary

### Capability  
Power to navigate complexity through judgment, sense-making, and meaning-making across time horizons. Capability speaks to how a person holds ambiguity, integrates variables, and anticipates consequences. Capability develops over time and sets the upper bound of complexity an individual can reliably carry.

### Ability  
Present, demonstrable skill and know-how—what can be executed now. Ability is grounded in applied knowledge and experience and changes with training, practice, and feedback.

### Capacity  
Scale, scope, and volume with which ability and capability can be applied—how much, how broad, how many. Capacity can be expanded through team design, tooling, process, and governance.

### Time Span of Discretion  
Length of time a role holder must sustain judgment before outcomes can be evaluated. Time span provides the most reliable measure of the level of work demanded by a role.

### Triad of Direction  
Three complementary disciplines guide organizational life across horizons. **Management** organizes work and ensures execution within known systems (present horizon). **Leadership** creates direction and alignment amid change (future horizon). **Stewardship** safeguards identity and continuity across time (enduring horizon). All three operate at every level, with different emphasis as horizon stretches.

## The Logic of Levels of Work

### Level of Work 1 — Quality  
Work is concrete, immediate, and procedural. Emphasis rests on accuracy, compliance, and tangible outputs within clear methods. Typical time span ranges from **one day to three months**. Roles include frontline operators, technicians, and assistants producing visible outputs against defined standards.
### Level of Work 2 — Service  
Work converts plans into coordinated action. Emphasis rests on scheduling, sequencing, and tailoring responses within policy. Typical time span extends to **three to twelve months**. Roles include team leads, unit coordinators, and supervisors translating methods into repeatable service.
### Level of Work 3 — Practice  
Work refines and integrates methods across value streams. Emphasis rests on diagnosing patterns, improving flow, and balancing efficiency with reliability. Typical time span ranges from **one to two years** for systemic improvement, with shorter cycles for operational tuning. Roles include functional managers, practice leads, and heads of continuous improvement.
### Level of Work 4 — Strategic Development  
Work designs and scales systems that align resources, processes, and people to longer-term objectives. Emphasis rests on architecture, sequencing programs, and integrating interdependent functions. Typical time span stretches from **two to five years**. Roles include general managers, business architects, and enterprise-wide program leaders.
### Level of Work 5 — Strategic Intent  
Work shapes the direction, viability, and resilience of the enterprise across multi-year horizons. Emphasis rests on shaping context, choosing bets, and balancing adaptability with coherence. Typical time span extends from **five to ten years**. Roles include enterprise executives and board-facing leaders who carry institution-level consequences.
### Level of Work 6: Corporate Citizenship
Focuses on guiding the organization as a responsible, ethical, and value-creating institution within society. Work involves shaping culture, governance, and social contribution to sustain trust and legitimacy. The time span—10 to 20 years—emphasizes stewardship, societal alignment, and enduring impact beyond immediate business performance.
### Level of Work 7: Corporate Prescience
Envisions the organization’s role within evolving global systems, anticipating transformations in society, technology, and ecology. Work at this level safeguards long-term coherence, guiding purpose across generations. The time span—20 to 50 years—focuses on foresight, institutional legacy, and shaping conditions for future relevance and renewal.

## Cognitive Basis: Jaques and Stamp

### Jaques and Stratified Systems Theory  
Stratified Systems Theory argues that organizations function best when roles are designed with explicit time spans and when individuals are placed where their judgment can sustain those spans. The central claim is structural and predictive: coherent alignment of roles to time span reduces friction, clarifies accountability, and improves throughput.

### Stamp’s Mode of Thinking  
Stamp explained why individuals cope differently with complexity by describing developmental modes that align with increasing strata of work. The **Declarative** mode works with concrete facts and immediate procedures. The **Cumulative** mode links steps into repeatable sequences. The **Serial** mode manages linear systems over extended cycles. The **Parallel** mode integrates multiple interdependencies over years and across systems. These modes describe how individuals hold and organize complexity, offering a language for appreciating emerging capability.

### Career Path Appreciation (CPA)  
CPA is a structured, dialogic method that reveals how a person structures time and complexity. The process estimates a person’s **current operating level** and **future mode**, informing development and succession without deterministic labeling or pass/fail scoring. CPA complements, rather than replaces, evaluation and other decision processes.

## Linking Capability, Ability, and Capacity  
Capability determines the upper bound of complexity and time a person can hold reliably. Ability expresses present execution of skills and methods. Capacity scales both across breadth, volume, and scope. Misalignment among the three produces predictable failure modes.

When capability exceeds ability, a person sees the right game but lacks the skills to play it; development should target specific methods and practice. When ability exceeds capability, a person executes expertly yet struggles as horizon and ambiguity expand; development should target sense-making, judgment, and the disciplined extension of time span. When capability and ability exceed capacity, a person performs well locally but stalls when scope multiplies; system scaffolding, team design, and tooling must extend reach.

## Decision Making Across Horizons  
Decision rights follow complexity. Work in the known-controlled space benefits from standardization and tight feedback. Work in unknown-controllable space calls for experimentation, short learning loops, and explicit risk framing. Work in unknown-uncontrolled contexts demands sensing, resilience, and stewardship, with slower, institution-level feedback cycles. Leaders iterate across these contexts as signals accumulate, continually matching the decision method to the level of work and horizon involved.

## Assessment, Evaluation, and Appreciation

### Assessment  
Assessment is a structured, diagnostic process for understanding the current state and future ability and capacity. Assessment gathers evidence; it does not assign value or carry consequences.

### Evaluation  
Evaluation applies judgment against defined criteria, compares evidence to benchmarks, and carries consequences. Evaluation is the formal decision step that supports accountability.

### Appreciation  
Appreciation is a qualitative, interpretive judgment about how a person makes sense of complexity across longer time spans. Appreciation estimates current and emerging **capability**, anticipates transition points, and informs role fit and development. Appreciation does not use scores and is never pass/fail.

### Using the Three Disciplines in Sequence  
Assessment informs by collecting structured evidence. Evaluation decides by applying criteria and accepting consequences. Appreciation interprets how the person holds complexity over time so growth and placement remain humane and accurate.

## Thresholds and Transitions

### Transition from Level 2 (Service) to Level 3 (Practice)  
This transition expands the locus of attention from local coordination to system performance. The leader shifts from optimizing a team’s plan to diagnosing patterns across value streams, instituting standards, and stabilizing flow. Stretch experiences include ownership of cross-functional improvement, responsibility for measurement systems, and stewardship of end-to-end quality.

### Transition from Level 3 (Practice) to Level 4 (Strategic Development)  
This transition shifts from method refinement to system architecture. The contributor begins to integrate multiple functions, sequence multi-year programs, and design operating models. Stretch experiences include platform redesign, portfolio-level resource allocation, and interface governance across functions.

### Transition from Level 4 (Strategic Development) to Level 5 (Strategic Intent)  
This transition enlarges horizon and consequence. The leader shapes context rather than only optimizing within it, balancing foresight with resilience. Stretch experiences include corporate strategy formation, enterprise risk framing, external stakeholder stewardship, and succession planning for institutional roles.

## Organizational Design with Levels of Work

### Role Architecture  
Role design begins by articulating the nature of work: the inherent complexity, interdependence, and time span of discretion. Clear roles specify the judgment to be exercised, the interfaces to be integrated, and the cadence at which evidence of results becomes meaningful. Level definitions serve as a checklist to confirm fit between the work and the expected time horizon.

### Vertical Layering and Horizontal Coupling  
Vertical design locates who holds which horizon; horizontal design governs how functions interlock. Healthy systems minimize gaps and overlaps in time span, ensuring that adjacent roles either share a horizon by design or hand off work cleanly across horizons. Interfaces are explicit, with decision rights calibrated to the complexity of the dependency.

### Governance and Stewardship  
At higher levels, stewardship becomes explicit. The work safeguards identity, license, and legitimacy across decades. Policies encode ethical standards; strategy incorporates societal expectations; succession protects purpose as individuals rotate. Stewardship disciplines ensure the enterprise honors commitments to customers, employees, owners, and communities over the enduring horizon.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Step 1: Name the Work  
Describe outcomes, interdependencies, and the time span of discretion. State the judgment calls that matter and how evidence of results will appear over time.

### Step 2: Calibrate the Horizon  
Place the role within the present, future, or enduring horizon. Anticipate the interfaces and governance needs that accompany this placement.

### Step 3: Specify Decision Rights  
Map routine, experimental, and emergent decisions to appropriate methods. Define escalation paths that reflect complexity rather than status.

### Step 4: Use Assessment, Evaluation, and Appreciation in Sequence  
Run **assessment** to diagnose the current state and future ability and capacity. Run **evaluation** to compare evidence to criteria and make consequential decisions. Run **appreciation** to interpret how the person makes sense of complexity over time, estimate current and emerging capability, and anticipate transition points; omit scores and pass/fail labels.

### Step 5: Align Development  
Target the correct domain. Build **ability** with training, methods, and practice. Stretch **capability** by extending time span with scaffolded responsibilities. Expand **capacity** through team design, tooling, and process that multiply individual contribution.

### Step 6: Design Scaffolding  
Install operating rhythms, information flows, and enabling technologies that sustain performance at the intended level of work. Ensure that individuals do not carry systemic load alone.

## Common Failure Modes

### Title-Based Layering  
Job titles masquerade as complexity labels. Decision rights remain unclear; execution oscillates between over-control and drift. Level definitions restore judgment-based differentiation.

### Ability–Capability Confusion  
Skill gaps are mistaken for limited potential, or potential is mistaken for readiness. Distinguishing ability, capability, and capacity prevents misdiagnosis and rework.

### Feedback Conflation  
Assessment is prematurely used to make decisions; evaluation is avoided; appreciation is misused as recognition. Keeping the sequence clean preserves trust: assessment is diagnostic, evaluation applies criteria and carries consequences, appreciation interprets how the individual holds complexity over time to estimate current and emerging capability.

## Conclusion  
Levels of Work provide a neutral grammar for matching people, roles, and horizons. **Elliott Jaques** contributed the irreducible measure of **time span** as the basis for level; **Gillian Stamp** contributed the means to appreciate how people think their way into longer spans and to apply the construct through Mode of Thinking and CPA. When organizations design around judgment requirements, staff for fit to complexity, and govern for continuity across horizons, they reduce friction, accelerate learning, and compound advantage over time. The payoff is performance in the present, coherence across the future, and continuity along the enduring arc.
