## Boards that Steward
**Target chapter length:** ~2,000 words  
**Target manuscript length:** ~52,000–62,000 words (business-book range; includes tools, short interludes, and endnotes).  
**Trim:** 6×9 hardcover
**By:** Jose J Ruiz
## What this book must do
**Job:** Define board work as stewardship of the enduring enterprise, with clear decision rights, practical governance mechanisms, and a disciplined relationship with management.  
**Non-job:** Teach management execution systems (covered elsewhere) or culture mechanics in depth (Book 5).

## Core claim
Boards fail in two predictable ways:
- They **under-steer** (rubber-stamp, defer, confuse oversight with trust).
- They **over-manage** (operate through the CEO, substitute control for governance, and slow the enterprise).

Stewardship is the third path: **protect the enduring, enable renewal, and hold management accountable for capability and integrity without doing management’s job**.

# Narrative devices (used in every chapter)
- A vignette (board meeting, crisis call, CEO transition, activist pressure, ethics breach).
- One governance move (two at most).
- The failure mode (capture, drift, paralysis, theater, operational meddling).
- A “Monday move” (what to change in the next board cycle).
- A one-page instrument (charter, agenda, dashboard, protocol, template).

# Book structure at a glance
- **Part I:** What stewardship is (and what it is not)
- **Part II:** Decision rights and boundaries (board, CEO, management)
- **Part III:** The stewardship system (cadence, committees, information, behavior)
- **Part IV:** Stewardship of the enduring (risk, culture signals, purpose, legitimacy)
- **Part V:** Renewal (succession, crises, stage shifts, and board evolution)

# Table of contents and chapter-by-chapter focus

## Introduction (2,500–3,500 words)
**The board that lost the plot**  
A board faces a defining moment (crisis, scandal, acquisition, or CEO exit). The meeting reveals confusion: who owns what, what must be protected, and what “good governance” actually means.

---

## Part I: Stewardship, not supervision
### Chapter 1 — Boards that Steward
Define stewardship: protecting purpose, legitimacy, continuity, and renewal across tenures and cycles.

### Chapter 2 — The two failures: rubber-stamp and overreach
How boards either disappear into trust or invade operations through anxiety.

### Chapter 3 — The stewardship stance
What stewardship looks like in practice: courage without drama, inquiry without interrogation, firmness without humiliation.

### Chapter 4 — The stewardship object
Make explicit what the board stewards:
- the enterprise’s enduring identity and legitimacy
- the CEO and top-of-house capability
- material risk and resilience
- governance integrity (including the board’s own behavior)

**Part I instrument:** Stewardship Scorecard (a one-page diagnostic of under-steering vs over-managing behaviors).

---

## Part II: Decision rights and boundaries
### Chapter 5 — The boundary: governance vs management
Clarify what boards decide, what they approve, what they monitor, and what they must not do.

### Chapter 6 — The board-CEO compact
How trust is built through clarity: what the CEO owes the board, what the board owes the CEO, and how the relationship avoids capture.

### Chapter 7 — The information problem
Why boards get either too much data or the wrong data. How to design information that supports judgment, not theater.

### Chapter 8 — Decisions that belong to the board
Typical board-level decisions: CEO selection/removal, enterprise risk appetite, capital allocation at scale, major transactions, executive compensation philosophy, audit integrity, and governance policy.

### Chapter 9 — The escalation path to the board
How issues should arrive: thresholds, signals, and clean “board packets” that show options, constraints, and recommendations.

**Part II instrument:** Decision Rights Charter (board vs CEO vs management) + Board Packet Template (one-page standard).

---

## Part III: The stewardship system (how boards actually work)
### Chapter 10 — Cadence that matches the enterprise
The annual governance rhythm: strategy, risk, talent, culture signals, audit, and performance reviews without calendar drift.

### Chapter 11 — Agenda design: fewer items, higher quality
How to structure meetings for real governance work: consent agenda, deep work blocks, pre-reads, and decision sequencing.

### Chapter 12 — Committees that do not fragment reality
Committee mandates that support coherence rather than siloed oversight. How committees hand off cleanly to the full board.

### Chapter 13 — Board composition as capability design
Skills, experience, independence, and interpersonal maturity. How to build a board that can steward under pressure.

### Chapter 14 — Board behavior under tension
How boards handle dissent, status, and power. How to prevent “smart people problems” from becoming governance failures.

**Part III instrument:** Annual Board Calendar + Meeting Operating System (agenda template, consent rules, and discussion protocols).

---

## Part IV: Stewardship of the enduring
### Chapter 15 — Purpose, legitimacy, and the enterprise’s right to exist
How boards steward legitimacy: stakeholders, reputation, ethical posture, and long-horizon commitments.

### Chapter 16 — Risk as a stewardship discipline
Risk appetite, resilience, and response readiness. How boards avoid both complacency and panic.

### Chapter 17 — Culture signals without culture theater
How boards oversee culture without writing slogans:
- what signals to monitor
- how to interpret patterns
- how to hold management accountable for values-in-action  
(Connects to Book 5 without duplicating it.)

### Chapter 18 — Integrity of systems: audit, controls, and truth
How boards ensure the enterprise can tell the truth about itself: reporting integrity, internal controls, incentives, and speak-up systems.

### Chapter 19 — Stewardship across horizons
How boards avoid Present-only governance by asking: what are we protecting long-term, what are we building, and what are we sustaining.

**Part IV instrument:** Stewardship Dashboard (risk, resilience, talent, culture signals, and legitimacy indicators—one page).

---

## Part V: Renewal (the board’s defining responsibility)
### Chapter 20 — CEO succession as stewardship
Why succession is not an event. How to build a continuous system: readiness, exposure, evaluation, and transitions.

### Chapter 21 — When the board must intervene
Clear criteria for intervention: integrity breaches, capability collapse, governance breakdown, existential risk. How to act decisively without destabilizing the enterprise.

### Chapter 22 — Crisis governance
How boards behave when time compresses: tighter thresholds, clearer roles, faster meeting cadence, and clean decision records.

### Chapter 23 — Boards across organizational stages
How governance needs shift across growth and institutional maturity: founder-era boards, scaling boards, institutional boards, renewal boards.

### Chapter 24 — The 90-day stewardship reset
A practical upgrade plan:
- clarify decision rights and escalation thresholds
- redesign cadence and agenda discipline
- rebuild dashboard and board packets
- reset CEO compact and evaluation norms
- close the gap between stated values and observed behaviors

**Part V instrument:** Succession Map (roles, readiness, development) + Crisis Protocol (roles, cadence, decision log).

## Conclusion (1,500–2,500 words)
**Stewardship that holds enables capability that endures**  
Close with the handoff: boards that steward create the conditions for values and behaviors to hold under pressure (Book 5) and for capability to survive leadership transitions and cycles.

# Word-count plan (so it lands like a real business book)
- 24 chapters × 2,000 words = **48,000**
- Introduction + conclusion = **4,000–6,000**
- Instruments, short interludes, endnotes allowance = **4,000–10,000**
- **Total target:** **56,000–62,000 words**
