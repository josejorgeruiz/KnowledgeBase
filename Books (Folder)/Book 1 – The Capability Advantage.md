## What this book must do
**Job:** Establish the series spine and give readers a usable map that holds across growth, pressure, and complexity.  
**Non-job:** Teach every framework exhaustively (deep dives belong in later volumes).

## The three layers of capability
Capability shows up as **three nested spaces**. Book 1 introduces them early (Part I) and uses them as a recurring diagnostic for the rest of the series.

1. **Individual capability (inner space):** the locus of sense-making, meaning-making, framing, solving, and the role’s timespan of discretion.  
2. **Organizational capability (middle space):** the designed system of roles, decision rights, borders of delegation/escalation, cadences, and horizons that lets judgment travel.  
3. **Institutional capability (outer space):** the enduring frame—purpose, legitimacy, identity, stewardship, and renewal across tenures and cycles.

**Nesting rule:** individual capability can only scale when the organization designs a container that fits the work, and the institution holds a coherent, enduring frame that protects what matters over time.

# Narrative devices (used in every chapter)
- A short vignette (a moment where reality breaks the story).
- One core concept (two at most).
- The failure mode (what goes wrong when the concept is missing).
- A “Monday move” (what to do next).
- A one-page instrument (prompt set, charter, diagnostic, or script).

# Book structure at a glance
- **Part I:** The capability problem and the nested layers
- **Part II:** The engine of capability (judgment and meaningful response)
- **Part III:** The architecture (autonomy, borders, and work managed in time)
- **Part IV:** Building and sustaining capability across stages

# Table of contents and chapter-by-chapter focus

## Introduction (2,500–3,500 words)
**The day the system broke**  
A vivid incident that looks like a “people problem,” but reveals a capability problem: unclear authority, slow sense-making, and values that do not hold under pressure.

---

## Part I: The capability problem (why effort does not scale)
### Chapter 1 — The Capability Advantage
Define capability as the organization’s repeatable ability to convert uncertainty into coordinated action without heroics.

### Chapter 2 — The three layers of capability
Introduce the nested model:
- Individual space (judgment and timespan)
- Organizational space (design, decision rights, horizons)
- Institutional space (purpose, legitimacy, endurance)

Show how most leadership breakdowns are misdiagnosed because the failure is in a different layer than where it appears.

### Chapter 3 — When layers collide
Common misalignments:
- High individual capability trapped in a weak organizational container.
- A strong operating system with an incoherent institutional frame.
- Institutional ambition with no organizational capacity to execute.

### Chapter 4 — The trap of performance theater
How activity, urgency, and “alignment language” substitute for real judgment, real decision rights, and real accountability.

### Chapter 5 — The real cost of incoherence
How incoherence shows up as rework, escalation churn, burnout, quality defects, missed bets, and culture fracture.

**Part I instrument:** The Capability Map (a one-page diagnostic that locates symptoms in the right layer and identifies the likely constraint).

---

## Part II: The engine of capability (judgment you can share)
### Chapter 6 — From noise to signal
Sense-making as a social discipline: what counts as evidence, how reality becomes discussable, and why weak sense-making creates false speed.

### Chapter 7 — Meaning-making: why this matters now
How leaders prevent “everything matters” by naming stakes, consequences, and who is impacted.

### Chapter 8 — Framing: choosing the problem worth solving
How teams stop solving the wrong problem efficiently. Clean frames produce clean trade-offs.

### Chapter 9 — Solving: action without pretending certainty
Thresholds, reversibility, and learning loops that maintain pace without gambling the enterprise.

### Chapter 10 — How judgment becomes portable
Shared language, shared thresholds, and shared review practices so judgment travels across teams and levels.

**Part II instrument:** The Meaningful Response Cadence (a one-page meeting script for sensing, meaning, framing, and solving).

---

## Part III: The architecture (autonomy that works and work managed in time)
### Chapter 11 — The autonomy principle
Autonomy is not a perk; it is a system for distributing judgment and speed safely.

### Chapter 12 — The border of delegation
What must be true for a decision to be truly delegated: authority, resources, constraints, and clarity.

### Chapter 13 — The border of escalation
Escalation is not failure; it is a designed safety mechanism. How to set thresholds that protect pace and integrity.

### Chapter 14 — The space of autonomy
Where real work happens: the protected space in which teams decide and act without politics.

### Chapter 15 — Work managed in time
Introduce the Management Horizon (Present, Future, Enduring) as the discipline for managing work in time without collapsing into short-termism.

### Chapter 16 — The triad of direction
Clarify management, leadership, stewardship as distinct disciplines, and show the organizational damage when they collapse into one.

**Part III instrument:** Decision Rights Charter (delegation, escalation, autonomy space, and thresholds).

---

## Part IV: Building capability as the organization grows
### Chapter 17 — DOES as the operating logic
Design and Organize create the conditions for Execute and Sustain; capability fails when organizations skip the front half.

### Chapter 18 — Organizational stages and the migration of capability
How requirements change across stages; what must be institutionalized and what must remain alive.

### Chapter 19 — The contribution ladder
Levels of work and Contribution Bands™ as the alignment mechanism for scope, timespan, and accountability.

### Chapter 20 — Culture as reinforcement, not wallpaper
Set up Book 5: culture as values and behaviors that show up under pressure.

### Chapter 21 — Governance that protects the enduring
Set up Book 4: boards steward the enterprise by protecting legitimacy, continuity, and renewal—without doing management.

### Chapter 22 — The build plan
A practical sequencing: what to stabilize first, what to redesign second, what to codify third, and what to steward always.

**Part IV instrument:** 90-day Capability Build Plan (stabilize → clarify → embed → review), explicitly mapped to the three layers.

## Conclusion (1,500–2,500 words)
**Capability as a promise**  
Capability is the promise that judgment will travel, autonomy will work, values will hold, and stewardship will protect the enduring. Hand off to Book 2: building judgment at speed.
