## Judgment at Speed
**Target chapter length:** ~2,000 words  
**Target manuscript length:** ~50,000–62,000 words (business-book range; includes tools, short interludes, and endnotes).  
**Trim:** 6×9 hardcover
**By:** Jose J Ruiz

## What this book must do
**Job:** Build the *engine* that makes capability usable under pressure: fast, shared judgment that converts ambiguity into aligned action.  
**Non-job:** Solve decision-rights design (Book 3) or governance stewardship (Book 4).

## Core model for Book 2
The book operationalizes the **Meaningful Response Cadence** as a repeatable discipline:
1. **Sense-Making** (what is true, what is not known, what is noise)  
2. **Meaning-Making** (why it matters, for whom, and by when)  
3. **Framing** (the real problem, the constraints, the trade-offs)  
4. **Solving** (move, learn, adapt; do not pretend certainty)

**Primary promise:** Speed improves when judgment is shared, not when authority is louder.

# Narrative devices (used in every chapter)
- A short vignette (a moment where speed meets uncertainty).
- One core move (two at most).
- The failure mode (thrash, politicking, paralysis, false certainty).
- A “Monday move” (what to do in the next meeting).
- A one-page instrument (scripts, checklists, thresholds, review templates).

# Book structure at a glance
- **Part I:** Why speed fails (and what “judgment at speed” is)
- **Part II:** The four-step engine (Sense, Meaning, Frame, Solve)
- **Part III:** The social infrastructure (dissent, thresholds, narrative, escalation hygiene)
- **Part IV:** Scaling judgment (across levels, teams, and time)

# Table of contents and chapter-by-chapter focus

## Introduction (2,500–3,500 words)
**The high-speed miss**  
A decision made “fast and confident” that later collapses. The postmortem reveals the real cause: weak sense-making, muddy framing, and unspoken trade-offs.

---

## Part I: Speed without judgment becomes thrash
### Chapter 1 — Judgment at Speed
Define the discipline: speed as *coordinated action with acceptable regret*, not motion.

### Chapter 2 — The two enemies: paralysis and false certainty
How teams oscillate between “wait for more data” and “act like we know,” and why both are coping strategies.

### Chapter 3 — The cost of rework
Reversals, churn, and escalation fatigue as symptoms of weak framing and weak thresholds.

### Chapter 4 — The condition for speed: shared reality
Why speed requires a shared picture of what is true, what matters, and what the constraints are.

**Part I instrument:** Speed trap diagnostic (symptoms → which step in the cadence is failing).

---

## Part II: The engine (Sense, Meaning, Frame, Solve)
### Chapter 5 — Sense-Making: separate signal from noise
How to establish evidence quality, source credibility, and “unknowns that matter.”

### Chapter 6 — Sense-Making under ambiguity
How to act when data is late, partial, or political; how to use ranges, scenarios, and thresholds without over-modeling.

### Chapter 7 — Meaning-Making: name stakes and time
Meaning-making as the discipline of naming consequences, stakeholders, and urgency without panic.

### Chapter 8 — Meaning-Making across horizons
How “Present, Future, Enduring” show up inside meaning-making so teams do not optimize the week at the expense of the institution.

### Chapter 9 — Framing: choose the problem worth solving
How to produce a clean problem statement, constraints, and trade-offs; how to expose hidden agendas respectfully.

### Chapter 10 — Framing failures (and how to catch them early)
Symptom patterns: solving the wrong problem, fighting about solutions, debating identity instead of constraints.

### Chapter 11 — Solving: move without gambling
Reversible vs irreversible moves, limited bets, and “next best action” when certainty is unavailable.

### Chapter 12 — Solving with learning loops
How to design feedback so the organization gets smarter, not just busier.

**Part II instrument:** The Meaningful Response Meeting Script (a one-page facilitation guide for Sense → Meaning → Frame → Solve).

---

## Part III: The social infrastructure that makes judgment travel
### Chapter 13 — Dissent that increases speed
How to design disagreement so it improves judgment quickly instead of becoming performance or politics.

### Chapter 14 — Thresholds: the hidden architecture of judgment
What thresholds do (and why they work): escalation triggers, decision reversibility tests, risk limits, and “stop rules.”

### Chapter 15 — The minimum viable narrative
How leaders create fast alignment with a short narrative: what’s true, what matters, what we’re doing, what we’ll watch.

### Chapter 16 — Escalation hygiene (without dumping problems upward)
How to escalate cleanly: what must be included, when to escalate, and what decisions remain local.

**Part III instrument:** The Dissent Protocol + Threshold Library (templates leaders can reuse across teams).

---

## Part IV: Scaling judgment across the organization
### Chapter 17 — Judgment across levels of work
How framing and solving change as scope, timespan, and consequence expand; how leaders stop “helping” by taking over.

### Chapter 18 — Judgment across teams and interfaces
How to prevent local optimization; how to align frames across functions without endless coordination.

### Chapter 19 — Judgment under stress: crisis, reputational risk, and time compression
How to tighten thresholds, simplify narratives, and preserve humanity when stakes spike.

### Chapter 20 — Building a judgment culture
How values and behaviors show up in judgment: truth-telling, accountability, learning, and respect. Set up Book 5 without turning this into a culture book.

### Chapter 21 — The 90-day judgment build
A practical rollout: train the cadence, adopt scripts, install thresholds, and normalize after-action learning.

**Part IV instrument:** Judgment Operating Kit (cadence + scripts + thresholds + after-action template).

## Conclusion (1,500–2,500 words)
**Judgment that travels becomes autonomy that works**  
Close with the handoff: when judgment is shared at speed, the organization is ready for Book 3—designing autonomy (delegation, escalation, and decision rights) so action remains reliable at scale.

# Word-count plan (so it lands like a real business book)
- 21 chapters × 2,000 words = **42,000**
- Introduction + conclusion = **4,000–6,000**
- Instruments, short interludes, endnotes allowance = **6,000–14,000**
- **Total target:** **52,000–62,000 words**
