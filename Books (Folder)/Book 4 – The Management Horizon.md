## The Management Horizon
**Center of gravity:** how work is managed in time across **Present, Future, Enduring**  
**Target chapter length:** ~2,000 words  
**Target manuscript length:** ~52,000–62,000 words (business-book range; includes tools, short interludes, and endnotes).  
**Trim:** 6×9 hardcover

## What this book must do
**Job:** Make the Management Horizon usable as an operating discipline. Readers should leave with a practical way to:
- separate Present work from Future work from Enduring work without creating silos
- allocate attention, capacity, and decision rights across horizons
- run cadences that prevent Present urgency from consuming the enterprise
- use horizons to clarify what management owns, what leadership changes, and what stewardship protects

**Non-job:** Re-teach autonomy border mechanics (Book 3), board governance (Book 4), or culture tooling (Book 5). This book connects to them by showing how horizon discipline prevents escalations, politics, and value drift.

## Core claim
Most organizations do not fail because they lack strategy. They fail because they **manage all work as Present work**.

The Management Horizon restores coherence by making three categories explicit:
- **Present:** reliability, delivery, performance, commitments, operational integrity
- **Future:** adaptation, bets, capability building, redesign, change
- **Enduring:** identity, legitimacy, principles, continuity, resilience, renewal

# Narrative devices (used in every chapter)
- A vignette (a leadership meeting where everything becomes urgent).
- One horizon move (two at most).
- The failure mode (Present capture, change theater, brittle systems, drift).
- A “Monday move” (what to change in the next cadence).
- A one-page instrument (portfolio map, horizon agenda, capacity rules, review template).

# Book structure at a glance
- **Part I:** The failure pattern (Present capture)
- **Part II:** The Management Horizon model (Present, Future, Enduring)
- **Part III:** Governing work in time (portfolios, capacity, cadences)
- **Part IV:** Operating across horizons (DOES and the triad of direction)
- **Part V:** Horizon integrity at scale (stages, crises, and renewal)

# Table of contents and chapter-by-chapter focus

## Introduction (2,500–3,500 words)
**The week that ate the year**  
A leadership team “wins the week” repeatedly, but loses the year. The root cause is not effort. The root cause is a collapsed horizon: Future and Enduring work never get protected.

---

## Part I: The failure pattern
### Chapter 1 — The Management Horizon
Define the discipline: managing work in time is a managerial capability, not a planning artifact.

### Chapter 2 — Present capture
How operational urgency colonizes attention, and why high performers often enable the trap.

### Chapter 3 — Change theater
Why organizations announce transformation while running the same Present cadence, with no protected Future capacity.

### Chapter 4 — Enduring drift
How values, legitimacy, and institutional integrity erode quietly when Enduring work becomes “later.”

**Part I instrument:** Horizon Symptom Scan (signals of Present capture, Future starvation, Enduring drift).

---

## Part II: The model (Present, Future, Enduring)
### Chapter 5 — Present work: reliability as a promise
What Present work really is: commitments, standards, quality, cost, safety, service, and operational truth.

### Chapter 6 — Future work: adaptation and capability building
Future work as designed learning: bets, redesign, new capabilities, deliberate change, and managed experimentation.

### Chapter 7 — Enduring work: continuity and legitimacy
Enduring work as protection and renewal: purpose, principles, reputational integrity, resilience, and institutional memory.

### Chapter 8 — Horizon boundaries and handoffs
How work moves between horizons without confusion:
- when Future becomes Present (standardize, integrate, scale)
- when Present triggers Future (persistent pain, structural limits)
- when Enduring constrains both (non-negotiables, legitimacy, identity)

**Part II instrument:** Horizon Map (work inventory by horizon + explicit transition criteria).

---

## Part III: Governing work in time
### Chapter 9 — Portfolio clarity: stop calling everything “priority”
How to structure a portfolio so trade-offs are real: commitments, bets, and non-negotiables.

### Chapter 10 — Capacity rules that protect the Future
How to prevent Future work from being raided:
- explicit capacity allocation
- protected time blocks
- “no new work” thresholds
- consequence rules for scope creep

### Chapter 11 — Cadences by horizon
Design three cadences that interlock:
- Present operating cadence (weekly reliability)
- Future build cadence (biweekly/monthly progress on bets)
- Enduring stewardship cadence (quarterly/annual integrity and renewal)

### Chapter 12 — Decision rights across horizons
How decision rights shift by horizon:
- Present: tighter controls and standards
- Future: defined freedom within constraints
- Enduring: principled boundaries and governance thresholds

**Part III instrument:** Horizon Cadence Kit (agenda templates + decision record prompts by horizon).

---

## Part IV: Operating across horizons (DOES + triad of direction)
### Chapter 13 — DOES as horizon logic
How DOES prevents collapse:
- **Design/Organize** protect Future and Enduring
- **Execute/Sustain** stabilize Present and institutionalize learning

### Chapter 14 — Management, leadership, stewardship across horizons
Use the triad as an operating discipline:
- **Management** makes Present reliable and turns bets into systems
- **Leadership** creates movement in the Future
- **Stewardship** protects the Enduring and sets non-negotiables

### Chapter 15 — Meetings that do not mix horizons
Why mixed-horizon meetings create confusion, and how to separate discussion types without fragmenting the enterprise.

### Chapter 16 — Metrics that match time
How to use horizon-appropriate measures:
- Present: reliability and integrity of delivery
- Future: learning velocity, capability milestones, option value
- Enduring: legitimacy indicators, resilience, continuity, trust signals

### Chapter 17 — Incentives and horizon integrity
How incentives destroy horizon discipline (Present-only rewards, Future-only charisma), and how to rebalance recognition and consequences.

**Part IV instrument:** Horizon Scorecard (a one-page dashboard with measures that match time).

---

## Part V: Horizon integrity at scale
### Chapter 18 — Horizons across organizational stages
How horizon discipline changes from Stage 1 through Stage 5:
- when the Present must harden
- when the Future must be protected
- when the Enduring must be formalized and stewarded

### Chapter 19 — Horizons under stress
Crisis compresses time. How to tighten thresholds without eliminating Future and Enduring work.

### Chapter 20 — Renewal: the Enduring made practical
How organizations renew without self-betrayal: pruning, re-founding decisions, and restoring legitimacy when trust is damaged.

### Chapter 21 — The 90-day Management Horizon build
A practical rollout:
- horizon inventory and map
- capacity allocation rules
- cadence install (three interlocking cadences)
- decision-rights alignment by horizon
- horizon scorecard and review discipline

**Part V instrument:** 90-day Horizon Build Plan (owners, cadence, measures, and risk controls).

## Conclusion (1,500–2,500 words)
**Time is the hidden operating system**
Organizations become coherent when they manage work in time: Present reliability, Future adaptation, Enduring integrity. The Management Horizon is not a framework to admire. It is a discipline to run.

# Word-count plan (so it lands like a real business book)
- 21 chapters × 2,000 words = **42,000**
- Introduction + conclusion = **4,000–6,000**
- Instruments, short interludes, endnotes allowance = **6,000–14,000**
- **Total target:** **52,000–62,000 words**
