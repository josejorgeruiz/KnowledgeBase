## Culture That Holds
**Center of gravity:** values and behaviors, with the **Cultural Coherence Prism** at the center  
**Target chapter length:** ~2,000 words  
**Target manuscript length:** ~52,000–62,000 words (business-book range; includes tools, short interludes, and endnotes).  
**Trim:** 6×9 hardcover
**By:** Jose J. Ruiz
## What this book must do
**Job:** Make culture governable without turning it into compliance or vibes. The reader should leave with a usable method for defining values as trade-offs, translating them into observable behaviors, reading the culture with the Cultural Coherence Prism, and embedding those behaviors into how work actually happens.  
**Non-job:** Re-teach autonomy mechanics (Book 3) or board governance (Book 4). This book links to them by showing how culture is reinforced (or degraded) through those systems.

## Core claim
Culture is not what people say. Culture is **what people do when pressure rises**.  
Values are not beliefs written on a wall. Values are **choices under trade-offs**.  
Behaviors are not aspirations. Behaviors are **observable patterns** that can be coached, rewarded, and required.

The Cultural Coherence Prism is the practical instrument that converts culture from abstraction into a readable, discussable system.

# Narrative devices (used in every chapter)
- A vignette (a “values moment” under pressure).
- One culture move (two at most).
- The failure mode (hypocrisy, cynicism, fear, fragmentation, performative values).
- A “Monday move” (a concrete intervention in the next week).
- A one-page instrument (Prism readout template, values-as-trade-offs worksheet, behavior anchors, ritual audit, coaching scripts).

# Book structure at a glance
- **Part I:** What culture is (and why it fails to hold)
- **Part II:** The Cultural Coherence Prism (how to read the real culture)
- **Part III:** Values as trade-offs (how to make values real)
- **Part IV:** Behaviors that hold (how to make values observable)
- **Part V:** Embedding and sustaining (rituals, systems, leadership, and governance signals)

# Table of contents and chapter-by-chapter focus

## Introduction (2,500–3,500 words)
**The moment the values disappeared**  
A high-pressure decision reveals the real culture: what got protected, who got sacrificed, and how quickly trust broke. The organization did not “lose its values.” It never operationalized them.

---

## Part I: Culture is what holds under pressure
### Chapter 1 — Culture That Holds
Define culture as the organization’s default choices under pressure, expressed through norms and reinforced through systems.

### Chapter 2 — The two failures: slogans and cynicism
How values become wallpaper, and how cynicism becomes the culture when leaders do not translate values into behaviors.

### Chapter 3 — Culture is a system, not a speech
How culture is created by decisions, meeting norms, incentives, escalation patterns, hiring, promotion, and what leaders tolerate.

### Chapter 4 — Coherence and fragmentation
How culture fragments across functions, geographies, and levels when there is no shared interpretive frame.

**Part I instrument:** The Values Moment Audit (a one-page diagnostic: recent decisions under pressure and what they revealed).

---

## Part II: The Cultural Coherence Prism (reading what is true)
### Chapter 5 — The Prism: why beliefs matter
How beliefs shape what people notice, what they trust, and what they avoid saying.

### Chapter 6 — Reading the Prism: center, spread, skew
How to interpret:
- **Center:** the default stance
- **Spread:** tolerance for belief diversity
- **Skew:** minority positions that can be innovation, dissent, or fracture points

### Chapter 7 — The ten culture dimensions (as levers)
Use the Prism dimensions as leadership levers (not personality labels):
1) Discipline (Flexible ↔ Strict)  
2) Formality (Ambiguous ↔ Defined)  
3) Awareness (Internal ↔ External)  
4) Fertility (Open ↔ Closed)  
5) Status (Accomplishment ↔ Attribution)  
6) Authority (Participative ↔ Autocratic)  
7) Purpose (Organic ↔ Mechanic)  
8) Reliance (Dependent ↔ Independent)  
9) Community (Group ↔ Individual)  
10) Involvement (Diffuse ↔ Specific)

### Chapter 8 — Coherence without uniformity
How to maintain coherence while allowing local variation: what must be shared, what can differ, and what must never be compromised.

**Part II instrument:** Prism Readout Template (how to capture center/spread/skew and interpret the ten dimensions).

---

## Part III: Values as trade-offs (making values real)
### Chapter 9 — Values are choices under constraints
How to define values in a way that forces clarity: what the value protects, what it refuses, and what it costs.

### Chapter 10 — The trade-off language of values
How to rewrite values so they specify:
- the decision tension they govern
- the boundary they create
- the sacrifice they require

### Chapter 11 — When values collide
How to arbitrate value conflicts without hypocrisy: priority rules, escalation triggers, and decision records.

### Chapter 12 — Values across horizons
How values must hold in Present, Future, Enduring, and how leaders prevent “short-term exceptions” from becoming the real culture.

**Part III instrument:** Values-as-Trade-offs Worksheet (value → protected good → trade-offs → non-negotiables → escalation triggers).

---

## Part IV: Behaviors that hold (making values observable)
### Chapter 13 — Behaviors are the unit of culture
Why culture changes when behavior changes, and why behavior changes when leaders coach, require, and reinforce.

### Chapter 14 — Behavioral anchors by level of work
How the same value expresses differently across scope and timespan:
- frontline, manager, executive, board interface behaviors

### Chapter 15 — Coaching values without moralizing
Practical scripts for:
- reinforcing behavior
- correcting misalignment
- handling defensiveness and status

### Chapter 16 — Hiring and promotion for values-in-action
How to assess behaviors fairly: structured evidence, pattern checks, reference prompts, and avoiding “culture fit” as bias cover.

### Chapter 17 — Accountability and repair
How to handle breaches: distinguish mistake vs pattern, apply proportionate consequences, and restore trust through repair.

**Part IV instrument:** Behavior Library Template (value → 5–7 observable behaviors → examples → derailers → coaching prompts).

---

## Part V: Embedding and sustaining culture
### Chapter 18 — Rituals and routines: where culture is made
Meetings, reviews, decision logs, and escalation moments as the primary “culture-making machinery.”

### Chapter 19 — Incentives and signals
How compensation, recognition, and status signals either reinforce or destroy values-in-action.

### Chapter 20 — Culture and autonomy
How borders of delegation/escalation either protect values or force hypocrisy when pressure rises. Clean linkage to Book 3.

### Chapter 21 — Culture and stewardship
How boards oversee culture without slogans:
- what signals to request
- how to interpret Prism movement
- how to hold management accountable for coherence  
Clean linkage to Book 4.

### Chapter 22 — The 90-day culture build
A practical rollout:
- run the Values Moment Audit
- complete a Prism readout for the top two layers (executive + one critical frontline domain)
- rewrite values as trade-offs
- publish the behavior library
- embed into hiring, promotion, and meeting cadence
- install review and repair mechanisms

**Part V instrument:** Culture Operating Kit (Prism readout + value trade-off worksheet + behavior library + ritual audit + repair protocol).

## Conclusion (1,500–2,500 words)
**Culture is the integrity of the system**
When values and behaviors hold, judgment moves faster, autonomy stays safe, and stewardship becomes trustworthy. Culture is not an overlay. It is the reinforcement layer that keeps the entire capability system from degrading under pressure.

# Word-count plan (so it lands like a real business book)
- 22 chapters × 2,000 words = **44,000**
- Introduction + conclusion = **4,000–6,000**
- Instruments, short interludes, endnotes allowance = **6,000–12,000**
- **Total target:** **54,000–62,000 words**
