The basic talent management cycle is a continuous, integrated process that aligns an organization’s people strategy with its business goals. It typically includes the following key stages:
# Workforce Planning

Defines the organization’s current and future talent needs. It involves analyzing business strategy, identifying critical roles, and forecasting skill requirements to ensure the right talent is available when needed.
## Talent Acquisition

Covers the processes of attracting, sourcing, assessing, and hiring candidates. This includes building employer branding, recruiting through various channels, conducting assessments or interviews, and ensuring alignment between the candidate’s potential and the organization’s needs.
## Onboarding

Integrates new hires into the organization, helping them understand its culture, values, systems, and expectations. Effective onboarding improves engagement, performance, and retention in the critical early months.
## **Performance Management**

Ensures alignment between individual goals and organizational objectives. It includes regular feedback, performance reviews, and coaching to foster accountability and growth.
## Learning and Development

Focuses on building the capabilities and competencies employees need to perform current roles and prepare for future ones. It includes training, mentoring, coaching, and career development programs.
## Succession and Career Planning

Identifies and prepares high-potential employees for key positions. The goal is to ensure leadership continuity and career mobility within the organization.

## Compensation and Rewards

Aligns incentives with performance and contribution. It includes salary, bonuses, recognition programs, and non-monetary rewards to reinforce desired behaviors and motivate sustained performance.

## Retention and Engagement

Focuses on maintaining a motivated, committed workforce through culture, recognition, well-being, and purposeful work. High engagement supports productivity, innovation, and long-term retention.

## Evaluation and Continuous Improvement

Uses analytics, feedback, and metrics to assess the effectiveness of talent practices and adjust them to evolving business needs. This closes the loop of the cycle, feeding back into workforce planning.
