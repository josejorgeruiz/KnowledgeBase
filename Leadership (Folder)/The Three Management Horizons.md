## Aligning Levels of Work with Time, Complexity, and Stewardship

### Excerpt

Executives do not run a single calendar. They hold three horizons at once: the present system that must perform, the future that must be shaped, and the enduring identity that must be stewarded. This paper explains the Management Horizon framework and maps the Levels of Work inside each horizon so leaders can align judgment, structure, and accountability across time.

### Abstract

The Management Horizon framework integrates three interwoven horizons—Present, Future, and Enduring—to clarify how organizations engage time, complexity, and purpose. Each horizon expresses a distinct center of gravity: managing performance (Present), leading transformation (Future), and stewarding continuity (Enduring). Within each horizon sit specific Levels of Work that define the scale, scope, and time span of discretion. This concept paper synthesizes these elements to provide leaders with a cohesive operating logic. We describe the cognitive underpinnings of capability and Mode of Thinking, connect horizon work to the DOES cycle (Design, Organize, Execute, Sustain), and show how governance and culture translate intent into disciplined freedom. The result is a practical map for aligning role design, succession, strategic cadence, and operating mechanisms across different spans of time so that near‑term reliability, mid‑term renewal, and long‑term coherence reinforce each other rather than compete.

### Introduction

Organizations falter when today’s execution, tomorrow’s transformation, and the institution’s longer view are managed as separate agendas. The Management Horizon framework treats them as a single system. It defines how far into the future leaders can responsibly make and execute decisions in the absence of immediate feedback, and it clarifies which kind of work belongs where. This paper translates the framework into actionable guidance by detailing the Levels of Work inside each horizon and describing how leaders should rebalance their attention as context shifts.

## The Framework At A Glance

The Management Horizon links three disciplines—management, leadership, and stewardship—across three spans of time. The horizons are concurrent, not sequential. In a resilient enterprise the three coexist: day‑to‑day performance is stable, the next form is being built, and the organization’s identity is protected and evolved. Levels of Work articulate the qualitative jump in judgment and time span required as responsibility moves from tasks to processes, systems, enterprise direction, and ultimately societal role.

## The Present Horizon

### Purpose and Span

The Present Horizon ensures current performance and system reliability. Its typical span is up to two years, where feedback loops are short enough to learn quickly and correct course without destabilizing the enterprise.

### Levels of Work in the Present Horizon

#### Level 1 — Quality

Work is concrete and procedural. The focus is producing consistent, accurate outputs against defined standards. The time span is day‑to‑day up to a few months. People succeed here through task discipline, attention to detail, and adherence to methods.

#### Level 2 — Practice

Work refines methods within defined systems. Judgment is applied to recurring problems and service consistency. The time span extends to roughly a year. The center of gravity is dependability, adaptability within standards, and the craft of reliable service.

#### Level 3 — Practice as Continuous Improvement

Work designs and improves processes that knit tasks into flow. Judgment moves from doing to integrating—diagnosing bottlenecks, redesigning handoffs, and embedding learning loops. The span stretches to a couple of years, long enough to prove, stabilize, and scale improvements.

### Management Implications

In the Present Horizon, **Execute** dominates while **Organize** and **Design** provide scaffolding. Leaders should:

* Codify operating standards and visible measures of quality and cycle time.
* Build problem‑solving routines and daily/weekly cadences that convert variation into learning.
* Staff roles for current capability and coach for the next level of discretion.

## The Future Horizon

### Purpose and Span

The Future Horizon converts strategic intent into transformation. Its span typically ranges from two to five years—the window where portfolios shift, platforms are built, and new operating models take hold.

### Levels of Work in the Future Horizon

#### Level 3 — Practice as Innovation

Work experiments at the edge of current practice. Judgment focuses on hypothesis, iteration, and evidence of viability. The time span is one to two years—enough to pilot, iterate, and either scale or stop.

#### Level 4 — Strategic Development

Work designs and builds cross‑functional systems. Judgment integrates multiple functions and allocates resources coherently. The span of discretion extends to two to five years as leaders reconfigure structures, technology, and talent to enable growth and resilience.

#### Level 5 — Strategic Intent as Direction

Work defines future trajectory. Judgment anticipates change, positions the enterprise, and aligns strategy with external realities. The time span reaches five to ten years, where choices about markets, platforms, and capabilities compound.

### Management Implications

In the Future Horizon, **Design** and **Organize** rise while **Execute** becomes disciplined adaptation at scale. Leaders should:

* Establish explicit strategic hypotheses and option sets with staged investment.
* Orchestrate cross‑functional roadmaps and capacity plans tied to value streams.
* Use governance to protect exploration (innovation) while gating scale‑up through evidence.

## The Enduring Horizon

### Purpose and Span

The Enduring Horizon stewards institutional identity, societal role, and long‑term viability. Its span extends beyond the tenure of current leaders—ten to fifty years—requiring judgment under deep uncertainty and delayed feedback.

### Levels of Work in the Enduring Horizon

#### Level 5 — Strategic Intent as Viability

Work ensures survival and value creation across cycles. Judgment balances innovation with resilience, translating purpose into coherent guardrails and renewal mechanisms over a five‑to‑ten‑year span.

#### Level 6 — Corporate Citizenship

Work guides the organization as a responsible, ethical institution. Judgment shapes culture, governance, and social contribution to sustain legitimacy and trust across a ten‑to‑twenty‑year horizon.

#### Level 7 — Corporate Prescience

Work anticipates shifts in global systems—technology, ecology, society—and protects institutional coherence across generations. Judgment imagines futures, shapes conditions, and safeguards the organization’s capacity to remain relevant over multi‑decade spans.

### Management Implications

In the Enduring Horizon, **Sustain** becomes generative. Leaders should:

* Tie purpose and values to explicit viability criteria and risk ethics.
* Build leadership pipelines, succession, and knowledge systems as strategic assets.
* Use stewardship metrics—trust, legitimacy, resilience—alongside financial performance.

## Cognitive Underpinnings and Role Fit

Levels of Work track with human information‑processing capability. As roles require longer spans and denser interdependencies, thinking progresses from concrete and additive to serial cause‑effect and, eventually, to parallel systemic integration. This cognitive progression explains why mis‑matching a role’s time span and a person’s mode of thinking degrades quality, slows cycles, and erodes trust. Assessment should therefore consider both **current operating level** and **future mode** when designing roles, transitions, and development plans.

## How DOES Expresses Across the Horizons

The DOES cycle—**Design, Organize, Execute, Sustain**—is universal, but the emphasis shifts by horizon:

* **Present:** Execute dominates, supported by Organize; Design clarifies near‑term priorities; Sustain institutionalizes continuous improvement.
* **Future:** Design and Organize orchestrate transformation; Execute scales what works while pruning what does not; Sustain protects renewal capacity amid change.
* **Enduring:** Sustain leads through foresight, leadership development, resilience, and values; Design curates long‑horizon bets; Organize keeps architecture adaptive; Execute delivers with reliability that reinforces institutional trust.

## Decision Landscapes and the Horizon of Accountability

Decision‑makers move between known/controlled, known/uncontrolled, unknown/controllable, and unknown/uncontrolled domains. The longer the horizon, the more decisions sit in the latter domains where foresight, experimentation, and resilience replace prediction and control. Management cadence must adapt accordingly: short‑interval control in the Present; portfolio learning and optioncraft in the Future; stewardship questions—legitimacy, purpose, and societal fit—in the Enduring.

## Governance, Culture, and Cadence

Horizon clarity should be embedded in governance and culture:

* **Mandates and Guardrails:** Boards articulate purpose, success definitions, and limits so executives can exercise disciplined freedom across all horizons.
* **Cadence and Rhythm:** Daily/weekly operating reviews stabilize the Present; quarterly/biannual portfolio reviews adjust the Future; annual/tri‑annual stewardship sessions examine identity, risk ethics, and generational bets.
* **Talent and Succession:** Match role time spans with assessed capability; design progressions that expose leaders to increasingly complex horizons; measure not only outcomes but the quality of judgment under uncertainty.

## Practical Uses of the Map

1. **Role Design:** Specify the level of work, time span, and dominant DOES emphasis for each role. Clarify decision rights, interfaces, and measures.
2. **Strategic Planning:** Separate exploit and explore cadences. Treat Future Horizon investments as options with explicit kill/scaling gates.
3. **Leadership Development:** Build experiences that cultivate mode‑of‑thinking shifts—rotations across functions, multi‑year system builds, and stewardship assignments.
4. **Operating Model:** Organize around end‑to‑end value streams so Level‑3 work can integrate and Level‑4 work can redesign systems without disrupting quality.
5. **Risk and Resilience:** Tie horizon decisions to distinct risk postures—operational control (Present), intelligent risk‑taking (Future), and values‑anchored prudence (Enduring).

## Conclusion

The Management Horizon is a single architecture of time. It clarifies what kind of judgment is required now, what must be built next, and what must endure beyond us. Mapping Levels of Work inside each horizon equips leaders to align role design, cadence, and culture so that reliability today funds renewal tomorrow and preserves legitimacy for the long run. When leaders hold all three horizons in disciplined balance, the organization becomes both high‑performing and enduring—a system that delivers results, evolves coherently, and serves its stakeholders across generations.
