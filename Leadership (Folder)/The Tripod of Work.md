## Excerpt  

The Tripod of Work, developed by Gillian Stamp, describes how managers create the conditions for effective judgment and sustained flow through three interdependent disciplines: tasking, trusting, and tending. When held in balance, the tripod turns roles into spaces of autonomy where people can use their full capability; when distorted, it produces rigidity, diffusion, and eventual organizational failure.

## Abstract  

The Tripod of Work is a management practice model created by Gillian Stamp within the Bioss tradition to explain how responsibility is conferred, supported, and contained in organizational life. It proposes that effective work relationships between a manager and their team rest on three complementary activities: tasking (defining outcomes and limits), trusting (delegating judgment and discretion), and tending (maintaining relevance, context, and support). Together, these disciplines create the conditions for psychological flow, sound judgment, and sustainable performance.  

Stamp’s work emerged from long-term observation of how people experience “misuse” (challenges that significantly exceed their capability) and “disuse” (challenges that fall below it), and how these states damage both individuals and organizations. The Tripod of Work offers a practical response: by calibrating tasking, trusting, and tending, managers can help people operate at the right level of challenge and autonomy, preserving well-being and unlocking contribution.  

This paper presents the Tripod as articulated by Gillian Stamp and situates it within contemporary organizational design. It outlines the optimal configuration of the tripod, describes its distorted forms—the rigid tripod, the diffuse tripod, and the tripod of continuity—and connects the model to related constructs such as levels of work, the management horizon, and spaces of autonomy. It concludes with implications for management practice, particularly for leaders who must balance control and freedom in environments of growing complexity and uncertainty.

## Introduction  

Managers rarely fail because they lack effort or good intention. More often, they fail because the way they structure responsibility quietly undermines the people who report to them. Work is handed over without clarity, monitored without trust, or left alone without support. Over time, individuals experience strain, disengagement, or drift—not because the organization lacks talent, but because the fundamentals of how work is framed and held have broken down.  

Gillian Stamp’s Tripod of Work model was developed precisely to illuminate this pattern. Working within the Bioss research and consulting tradition, she observed that the quality of the relationship between a manager and their team could be understood through three recurring activities: how work is defined, how judgment is trusted, and how ongoing relevance and context are tended. Small shifts in these activities produced large differences in experience—between flow and anxiety, between commitment and withdrawal.  

The Tripod of Work provides a language and structure for these dynamics. It conceptualizes the manager–subordinate relationship not as a one-time delegation of tasks, but as a living system that must be kept in tension and balance. In doing so, it offers a foundational pattern for modern organizational design, especially in settings where autonomy is encouraged but must remain coherent with enterprise purpose, risk appetite, and long-term stewardship.

## The Origins and Intent of the Tripod of Work  

Stamp’s work sits in the same intellectual lineage as Stratified Systems Theory and the broader Bioss emphasis on capability, time span of discretion, and flow at work. She observed that individuals thrive when the complexity and duration of their tasks match their current level of capability and when they are trusted to use their judgment within clear boundaries. When that match is broken—through misuse or disuse—people either narrow their role to cope or stretch it in ways that drift away from organizational needs.  

The Tripod of Work was designed as a practical bridge between these deeper theories and the everyday behaviors of managers. Its explicit intent is to help those with responsibility for others create conditions of “good work”: work in which people feel trusted, challenged at the right level, and connected to a clear sense of purpose and context. The tripod is therefore not a high-level leadership metaphor; it is a concrete description of the disciplines that make responsibility both safe and stretching.

## The Three Disciplines: Tasking, Trusting, and Tending  

### Tasking  

Tasking is the act of defining what is to be done and by when. In Stamp’s formulation, tasking is not a vague assignment; it is a disciplined conversation that clarifies outputs, quality parameters, cost constraints, and time scales. It translates aspirations and intentions into outcomes that can be owned.  

Effective tasking sets boundaries and expectations without scripting method. It names the completion time, the degree of discretion available, and the conditions under which the work should be reconsidered. Poor tasking, by contrast, either leaves the person guessing or over-specifies their actions to the point where judgment is unnecessary.  

In the language of levels of work and management horizons, tasking calibrates the time span and complexity of what is being asked. It anchors what “success” looks like for the present, what must be considered for the future, and what non-negotiables exist to protect enduring commitments.  

### Trusting  

Trusting is the act of granting people the right and responsibility to use their judgment within the parameters set by tasking. It is not a general feeling of confidence; it is a specific decision about which decisions the individual may take independently, which they should take in consultation, and which must be escalated.  

Stamp emphasizes that trust must be commensurate with capability and mandate. To be motivating, an individual needs to feel that they are trusted up to the limit of their current capability—neither restricted to mechanical execution nor exposed to risks and complexities they cannot yet carry. Trusting, in this sense, is a design choice that shapes how discretion is exercised.  

When trusting is absent or distorted, people experience either suffocating control or dangerous abandonment. In both cases, their judgment is compromised: either because it is never used or because it is stretched beyond sustainable limits.  

### Tending  

Tending is the ongoing care of the work, the context, and the person doing it. It involves monitoring without crowding, ensuring that the task remains relevant as circumstances shift, and maintaining the connections between individual effort and organizational purpose.  

Tending brings the environment back into view. A well-tended relationship updates priorities, adjusts resources, and keeps the narrative of “why this matters” alive. It includes reviewing progress, checking whether assumptions still hold, and making sure that the work still fits within the broader strategy and ethics of the organization.  

Crucially, tending is not micromanagement. It does not mean rewriting the work at every turn. It is the discipline of support and context: staying close enough to course-correct and to learn, without taking back judgment that has been legitimately entrusted.

## The Optimal Tripod: Flow, Judgment, and Well-Being  

When tasking, trusting, and tending are held in balance, they form an optimal tripod. In this configuration, individuals experience a state close to psychological flow: the challenge they face fits their capability, they are free to use their judgment, and they understand how their work contributes to something larger.  

In the optimal tripod:  

- Tasking sets clear outcomes and limits, so energy is focused rather than diffused.  
- Trusting invites the individual to exercise judgment, so they feel ownership and intrinsic motivation.  
- Tending keeps the work aligned with changing conditions and purpose, so their efforts remain relevant.  

This balance has several systemic effects. Judgment improves because people are working at a level of complexity that matches their capability. Learning accelerates because feedback is timely and specific. Commitment deepens because the relationship between effort and meaning stays visible.  

From an organizational perspective, the optimal tripod builds an internal capacity to adapt. As circumstances change, tending surfaces new information; tasking is realigned; trusting is renewed or recalibrated. The work system becomes a living loop rather than a static assignment chart.

## Suboptimal Forms: The Rigid and Diffuse Tripods  

Stamp also identified characteristic distortions of the tripod that emerge from organizational culture and environmental pressure. These suboptimal forms—rigid and diffuse—show what happens when one or more legs of the tripod is exaggerated or neglected.  

### The Rigid Tripod  

The rigid tripod often appears in organizations that have been insulated from external pressures and then face sudden exposure. In response, they tighten controls on costs, systems, and people. Internally, attention turns away from the environment and toward compliance with internal rules.  

In this pattern:  

- Tasking hardens into enforcing. Limits are set in concrete, and there is little room for judgment or adaptation.  
- Trusting collapses into distrust. People feel bound by controls yet not truly entrusted with responsibility.  
- Tending mutates into policing. Monitoring is experienced as surveillance, not support.  

The outcomes are predictable. Judgment turns into frustration; people are so constrained by rules that initiative withers. Coherence turns into alienation; the purpose behind requirements is no longer visible. Review turns into paralysis; information is collected and analyzed but rarely converted into action.  

The rigid tripod can survive in stable conditions, but even moderate turbulence exposes its fragility. Because people are not practiced in exercising judgment within guardrails, the organization struggles to respond responsibly when the environment shifts.  

### The Diffuse Tripod  

The diffuse tripod is almost the mirror image. It often arises when leaders attempt to relax controls, encourage creativity, and “empower” people without providing sufficient structure.  

Here:  

- Tasking degrades into handing over. Assignments are vague, limits are unclear, and completion expectations are not defined.  
- Trusting dissolves into mistrust. People may feel over-trusted—left “out on a limb” without the support or clarity they need.  
- Tending disappears into neglect. Strengths and weaknesses go unnoticed; individuals feel unprotected in the face of uncertainty.  

In this configuration, judgment becomes guesswork. Coherence dissolves into anomie—people wander without shared direction. Review becomes ignorance; there is little learning because data about what is actually happening is not systematically gathered or discussed.  

Over time, the diffuse tripod causes the organization to lose the ability to remain connected to its environment. Without clear promises, boundaries, or feedback, it becomes indistinguishable from its surroundings.

## The Tripod of Continuity  

In working with organizations that had long operated in stable, supply-driven environments, Stamp identified a further variant: the tripod of continuity. Its purpose is to support reliability and safety in contexts where continuity and risk minimization are paramount.  

Under the tripod of continuity:  

- Tasking is closer to instructing, with tight control over limits to avoid error.  
- Trusting takes the form of deploying people according to known knowledge and experience.  
- Tending is expressed as careful administration and record-keeping.  

Judgment here is largely deductive, drawing on established procedures and professional standards to manage deviations from stability. Coherence is built less on explicit shared purpose and more on loyalty and dependency. Review is heavily oriented toward documentation.  

This configuration is not inherently dysfunctional. In certain regulated or safety-critical environments, it may be both necessary and appropriate. The risk appears when such organizations must become more demand-driven or adaptive. Attempts to change often overshoot—sliding into rigid or diffuse patterns—because the underlying tripod disciplines are not consciously understood or deliberately rebalanced.

## The Tripod of Work in Contemporary Organizational Design  

In more recent organizational design work, Stamp’s Tripod of Work can be seen as a foundational pattern for designing spaces of autonomy. A “space of autonomy” is a bounded area of the value chain where a team can act without constant permission, provided it honors its external commitments and internal guardrails. Within such spaces, the tripod governs how autonomy is lived day to day.  

Tasking defines the mandate of the space: the outcomes promised, the constraints to respect, and the time horizons involved. Trusting defines decision rights within that mandate: which decisions are owned locally, which require consultation, and which must be escalated based on risk and uncertainty. Tending defines the rhythms and relationships that keep people, interfaces, and learning healthy: reviews, retrospectives, and boundary conversations.  

It is important to distinguish the Tripod of Work from broader institutional contributions such as management, leadership, and stewardship. The tripod operates at the level of daily practice within a team or unit. It answers the question, “How do we enact autonomy today?” Management, leadership, and stewardship operate across units and horizons, answering, “What must remain reliable, where are we headed, and what must endure?”  

Combined with concepts such as levels of work, contribution bands, and management horizons, the tripod becomes a practical design tool. It helps ensure that the complexity and time span of a team’s mandate are matched with appropriate tasking, trusting, and tending—and that autonomy is scaled in ways that are both adaptive and auditable.

## Implications for Managers and Organizations  

For individual managers, the Tripod of Work offers a diagnostic lens and a practice guide. When a team is underperforming, oscillating between burnout and boredom, or showing signs of confusion and frustration, the manager can ask three questions:  

- Is tasking clear, proportional, and time-bound, or has it become either enforcing or handing over?  
- Is trusting explicit and commensurate with capability, or has it drifted into distrust, over-trust, or abdication?  
- Is tending present as supportive monitoring and context, or has it hardened into policing or evaporated into neglect?  

By adjusting these disciplines, the manager can reset the working environment without resorting immediately to structural change or replacement of people. Modest improvements in how tasks are framed, how decisions are delegated, and how progress is followed often unlock significant latent capability.  

For organizations, the tripod suggests that culture is not an abstract “tone at the top” but the accumulated pattern of tasking, trusting, and tending across thousands of relationships. Designing for flow and autonomy therefore requires more than slogans about empowerment. It requires explicit standards for how work is assigned, how judgment is granted, and how support and oversight are carried out at each level of work.  

When the tripod is consciously embedded in job design, performance management, and leadership development, several benefits follow. Capability can be matched more precisely to role demands. Borders of delegation and escalation become clearer. Learning loops are easier to maintain. And the system becomes better able to navigate the ongoing tension between safety and stretch, continuity and change.

## Conclusion  

Gillian Stamp’s Tripod of Work remains one of the most practical and powerful models for understanding how responsibility is created and sustained in organizational life. By naming tasking, trusting, and tending as distinct yet interdependent disciplines, she provided managers with a language to describe—and improve—the everyday dynamics that make work either meaningful or intolerable.  

The model’s enduring value lies in its systemic subtlety. It does not romanticize freedom or control; it shows how both are necessary and must be carefully balanced. It does not treat autonomy as a simple on–off switch; it reveals the ongoing work required to keep autonomy safe, stretching, and aligned with purpose.  

As organizations continue to navigate environments of volatility and uncertainty, the Tripod of Work offers a grounded way to design spaces where people can exercise judgment, experience flow, and contribute at their full capability. Honoring Stamp’s insight means treating tasking, trusting, and tending not as incidental features of personality, but as disciplines of practice—disciplines that can be taught, observed, and refined over time.
