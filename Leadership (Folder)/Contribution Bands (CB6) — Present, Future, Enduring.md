Contribution Bands are a spectrum for locating individual flow, interpreting direction, and managing productive tension across horizons—independent of hierarchy and titles*

## Excerpt

Contribution Bands centers on the individual by identifying the Flow Band—the band on the spectrum where a person reliably performs and stays in flow. CB6 aligns contribution with the Management Horizons—Present (0–2 years), Future (2–5 years), and Enduring (5–20+ years)—and treats bands as zones with fuzzy edges rather than rigid steps. Band Three and Band Five are bridge roles in the overlaps between adjacent horizons, intentional places of organizational tension where intent is translated and reconciled across time. The Triad of Direction—Management, Leadership, Stewardship—occurs in every band; the band defines how each is expressed and lived. Crucially, scale and scope influence hierarchy and titles far more than the band: the Present, the Future, and the Enduring can each be addressed by an individual contributor, a head of teams, or a head of department with many direct and indirect reports.
## Abstract

Organizations often mistake titles for contribution and confuse schedule pressure with decision rights. CB6 reframes contribution as a repeatable pattern of decisions and deliverables within a defined scope and time span—captured as six bands across the Present, Future, and Enduring horizons. Bands are a spectrum, not stairs; edges are intentionally fuzzy. Band Three bridges Present and Future; Band Five bridges Future and Enduring. Each band specifies core contribution, decision scope, interpretation duties, signals, and development moves. The assessment protocol records Current Placement, Natural Span, Stretch Band, Risk Band, Evidence, and Development Actions. The Triad of Direction operates at every band; expression varies by band, not presence. Finally, CB6 decouples band from hierarchy: titles follow the scale and scope of work (team size, budget, risk radius, ecosystem breadth), while bands calibrate the complexity and time span of contribution. By centering on each person’s Flow Band, recognizing the fuzzy edges between bands, and making interpretation explicit at the seams, CB6 turns individual flow into coherent results across horizons—regardless of job title.
## Introduction

People do their best work when decision complexity, time span, and scaffolds match their capability—when they operate in a band where they remain in flow. CB6 provides a shared language to discover that placement and to move direction cleanly from enduring intent to near-term action. The Management Horizons locate work in time: Present concerns reliable delivery and short-cycle improvement; Future concerns piloting, scaling, and operating-model design; Enduring concerns direction, license, and identity. Bands are spectral zones. Two of them—Band Three and Band Five—sit in the overlaps between horizons and must be handled as deliberate bridge roles and places of organizational tension.

**Bridge roles and organizational tension.** Band Three is a bridge role positioned in the overlap of the Present and the Future—a deliberate place of organizational tension where near-term proof is converted into scalable practice—and can face either horizon; Band Five is a bridge role positioned in the overlap of the Future and the Enduring—an intentional tension where strategic direction is reconciled with long-run license—and can face either horizon.

The Triad of Direction—Management, Leadership, Stewardship—is present in every band. What changes band to band is how each is expressed in practice. And while bands calibrate contribution, hierarchy and titles are shaped by the scale and scope of the role: one can serve the Present, the Future, or the Enduring as an individual contributor, a head of teams, or a head of department leading many direct and indirect reports.

## Horizons as Overlapping Circles

Imagine the three horizons as overlapping circles. The overlaps are where learning becomes scale (Band Three) and where direction becomes viability (Band Five). When decisions touch multiple circles, horizon decision rights set the cadence, and the band calibrates how contribution and interpretation are expressed by the individual—independent of title.

## Bands as a Spectrum with Fuzzy Edges

CB6 avoids slotting people into stairs. Bands name recognizable patterns of contribution and time span, yet an individual can stand near a boundary and remain coherent. Orientation clarifies stance without altering the band: a Present-facing Band Three converts today’s improvements into pilots; a Future-facing Band Three sequences adoption across teams. A Future-facing Band Five shapes options and pathways; an Enduring-facing Band Five hardens guardrails to protect identity and license.

## Decision Scope by Horizon

**Present.** How do we deliver today and improve tomorrow’s run? Decisions address method selection and evolution, correct sequencing, and near-term trade-offs among speed, quality, and cost.  
**Future.** What do we pilot, scale, and architect for durable advantage? Decisions span value streams, platforms, interfaces, adoption criteria, and program sequencing.  
**Enduring.** Where do we point the enterprise, and how do we remain legitimate and coherent? Decisions set arenas and advantage logic, capital posture, governing principles, covenantal commitments, and the design of governance.

## Decoupling Band from Hierarchy and Titles

- **Band ≠ rank.** Bands calibrate the complexity and time span of contribution. Titles mainly reflect scale and scope: financial exposure, customer and regulator surface area, number of teams, and ecosystem breadth.
- **Many scales, same band.** A Band Four contributor might be a principal architect (individual contributor), a platform lead (head of teams), or a head of department (multiple direct and indirect reports). The band stays the same; title changes with scale and scope.
- **Every horizon, any title.** The Present, Future, and Enduring can each be owned by an individual contributor, a head of teams, or a head of department—what varies is the radius of effect, not the band’s meaning.

## The Six Contribution Bands (with interpretation duties and expression of the Triad)

### Band One — Execution (Present)

**Core contribution.** Execution completes defined work within established routines (≈0–3 months), protecting quality and on-time handoffs in stable systems.  
**Decision scope and interpretation.** Method compliance, correct sequencing, immediate speed–quality trade-offs; interpret standards from Band Two into clear local instructions; surface ambiguities for standard updates.  
**Signals.** First-pass yield, on-time completion, adherence to standards.  
**Expression of Management, Leadership, Stewardship.** Management shows up as visible standards and control of flow; Leadership as small, timely improvements and peer coaching; Stewardship as safety, ethics, and honoring commitments.  
**Scale and scope expressions.** IC: operator or specialist delivering to standard. Head of teams: shift lead ensuring handoffs and coaching. Head of department: area owner stabilizing multiple cells—same band, larger radius.

### Band Two — Mastery (Present)

**Core contribution.** Mastery refines local methods, coaches peers, and standardizes practice across shifts and functions (≈3–12 months).  
**Decision scope and interpretation.** Method selection and short-cycle improvement within a function; interpret Band Three scale decisions into teachable, auditable standards for Band One.  
**Signals.** Reduced cycle time and defects, improved handoffs, standards that hold across shifts.  
**Expression of Management, Leadership, Stewardship.** Management as disciplined standard work and capability building; Leadership as crafting and socializing the next better way; Stewardship as defending quality and system integrity.  
**Scale and scope expressions.** IC: senior practitioner and micro-trainer. Head of teams: cross-cell lead harmonizing practices. Head of department: method steward across a site.

### Band Three — Scaling (Bridge: Present ↔ Future)

**Core contribution.** Scaling orchestrates cross-team optimization, runs pilots, and converts proof into standardized, scalable practice (≈6–24 months).  
**Decision scope and interpretation.** Where to experiment, adoption criteria, scale-up sequencing; interpret Band Four platform intent into pilots and scale plans; distill evidence into enterprise standards for Bands Two and One.  
**Signals.** Pilot success rate, time-to-scale, value-stream flow efficiency.  
**Expression of Management, Leadership, Stewardship.** Management in operationalizing pilots and embedding controls; Leadership in experiment selection and choreography of adoption; Stewardship in respecting guardrails so local wins don’t erode coherence.  
**Scale and scope expressions.** IC: staff scaler or value-stream optimizer. Head of teams: pilot program lead across squads. Head of department: portfolio scaler coordinating multiple value streams.  
**Orientation and tension.** A bridge role and a place of productive tension—Present-facing when converting improvements to pilots; Future-facing when sequencing adoption at increasing scope.

### Band Four — Architecture (Future)

**Core contribution.** Architecture translates strategy into target-state designs and shared platforms (≈1–3 years), defining the operating model that scales.  
**Decision scope and interpretation.** Enterprise standards and guardrails, interfaces, cross-functional sequencing; interpret Band Five directional choices into platform boundaries and governance; ensure designs are implementable by Band Three and teachable by Band Two.  
**Signals.** Platform reuse, integration lead time, variance reduction at scale.  
**Expression of Management, Leadership, Stewardship.** Management through portfolioed delivery disciplines and risk controls; Leadership through platform design and program pathways; Stewardship through principled constraints that enable autonomy without fragmentation.  
**Scale and scope expressions.** IC: principal architect. Head of teams: platform owner. Head of department: enterprise architecture leader with broad stewardship of interfaces.

### Band Five — Compass (Bridge: Future ↔ Enduring)

**Core contribution.** Compass orients direction amid uncertainty (≈2–5 years): arenas and advantage logic, portfolio and capital allocation, guardrails and risk posture.  
**Decision scope and interpretation.** Market entry/exit, capital deployment across options, boundary conditions for the operating model; interpret Band Six principles and license constraints into directional choices and portfolio guardrails that Band Four can design against.  
**Signals.** Portfolio balance and return shape, clarity of advantage, option value.  
**Expression of Management, Leadership, Stewardship.** Management as portfolio cadence and decision hygiene; Leadership as pattern recognition, option shaping, and choice; Stewardship as alignment of direction with identity and obligations.  
**Scale and scope expressions.** IC: principal strategist. Head of teams: portfolio director. Head of department: divisional strategy head orchestrating cross-business options.  
**Orientation and tension.** A bridge role and intentional tension—Future-facing when shaping options and pathways; Enduring-facing when hardening guardrails to protect license.

### Band Six — Continuum (Enduring)

**Core contribution.** Continuum sustains identity and license across 5–10+ years: policy–culture–ecosystem alignment, resilience platforms, succession, cross-generational bets.  
**Decision scope and interpretation.** Succession, covenantal commitments, societal impact, ecosystem and endowment design; articulate principles and constraints that Band Five converts into portfolio guardrails; validate that lower-band actions preserve legitimacy and coherence.  
**Signals.** Reputation strength, regulator and stakeholder trust, crisis recovery speed.  
**Expression of Management, Leadership, Stewardship.** Management as institutional mechanisms that keep commitments real; Leadership as renewal options consistent with identity; Stewardship as guardianship of values, license, and continuity.  
**Scale and scope expressions.** IC: principal steward or ombud with cross-enterprise remit; head of teams: resilience or ethics office lead; head of department: enterprise steward overseeing multi-stakeholder covenants.

## Centering on the Individual: Finding the Flow Band

CB6’s purpose is to locate the Flow Band for each person—the band where contribution is effective, decisions are sound, and engagement is sustained without chronic over- or under-load. Natural Span describes the horizon and complexity a person gravitates toward and can sustain. Current Placement records where the person is contributing now. Evidence confirms that contribution and interpretation duties are handled reliably—especially in bridge assignments where tension is high and translation must be crisp. Throughout, remember: title follows scale and scope; band calibrates contribution.

## The Assessment Protocol

- **Place the work.** Declare the required band, the primary horizon, and the interpretation outputs expected. For bridge-heavy assignments, name the adjacent horizon and specify which decisions follow which horizon cadence.
- **Place the person.** Assess Natural Span via work samples, decision reviews, and signals. Record Current Placement from recent deliverables and independent decision span, including interpretation fidelity to the next band down.
- **Determine the Flow Band and orientation.** Align person and work within one band based on Evidence. If signals cluster near a boundary, set an explicit orientation (e.g., Present-facing Band Three or Enduring-facing Band Five).
- **Set stretch and risk.** Assign a Stretch Band one band up the spectrum; document the Risk Band. Two-band jumps demand exceptional scaffolds and explicit exit criteria.
- **Design scaffolds and Development Actions.** Present: standards, visual management, micro-coaching. Future: playbooks, platform roadmaps, interface ownership, program governance. Enduring: principles as guardrails, portfolio cadence, succession, resilience platforms. For bridge roles, define interpretation contracts: inputs received, translations produced, handoffs delivered, and latency/fidelity expectations.
- **Review and reset.** Update Current Placement, Natural Span, Stretch Band, Risk Band, Evidence, and Development Actions at agreed cadences; reset when signals stabilize higher or orientation shifts are consistently successful.

## Signals Over Sentiment

**Present signals:** first-pass yield, on-time completion, cycle-time reduction, defect reduction, standards that hold across shifts.  
**Future signals:** pilot success rate, time-to-scale, platform reuse, integration lead time, variance reduction across value streams.  
**Enduring signals:** portfolio return shape, clarity of advantage logic, regulator and stakeholder trust, crisis recovery speed.  
**Interpretation quality:** fidelity of translation, latency from decision to usable standard, rework due to ambiguity, alignment at the intended locus, escalation hygiene.

## Building Capability Through Flow, Scale, and Productive Tension

When people operate in their Flow Band—and interpretation is crisp—the Present becomes reliable and improvable, the Future becomes testable and scalable, and the Enduring remains coherent and trusted. Scale and scope determine hierarchy and title; bands determine the kind of decisions one can make reliably over time. Thus, an individual contributor may contribute at Band Five on a focused portfolio question, while a head of department may contribute at Band Three orchestrating broad adoption—their titles differ by radius, their bands by time span and complexity. Bridge roles harness tension: Band Three reconciles the urgency of delivery with the discipline of scale; Band Five reconciles the pull of opportunity with the obligations of legitimacy.

## Conclusion

CB6 presents bands as a spectrum with fuzzy edges, centered on the individual’s flow and anchored in the Management Horizons. Management, Leadership, and Stewardship occur in every band; the band shapes how they are expressed. By naming Band Three and Band Five as bridge roles and places of organizational tension, by decoupling bands from hierarchy and titles, and by making interpretation explicit, direction moves cleanly from principle to platform to practice while evidence flows back to sharpen judgment. Place the work, place the person, set stretch with guardrails, design scaffolds, and reset based on evidence. Govern by scope and time span, not rank. The enterprise delivers in the Present, scales in the Future, and remains coherent and trusted in the Enduring—at any title and at any scale.
