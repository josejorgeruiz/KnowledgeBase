## Excerpt
A practical framework for aligning sales talent to revenue strategy by reading six behavioral dimensions against five distinct growth horizons.
## Abstract
Many sales teams hire to a mythic archetype—“the extroverted hunter–closer”—and then wonder why results vary by market, stage, and offer. The Luks Prisma Sales Model resolves that mismatch. It couples five levels of revenue strategy with six behavioral dimensions to profile, select, and deploy sellers whose strengths actually fit the work. The five levels—retaining current revenue, expanding within existing accounts, acquiring new logos with today’s offers, expanding existing accounts with new offers, and creating new markets with new offers—describe progressively higher uncertainty and collaboration needs. The six dimensions—Type (Hunter–Farmer), Style (Empirical–Methodical), Intensity (Sprinter–Marathoner), Community (Individual–Group), Role (Leader–Collaborator), and Drive (Closer–Promoter)—capture how a salesperson tends to pursue opportunities and make trade-offs under pressure. This paper explains each dimension, shows how leanings shift by revenue level, and translates the model into decisions on hiring, team design, account assignment, handoffs, metrics, and development.
## Introduction
Ask ten executives for the “best sales profile” and most will describe a charismatic hunter who always beelines to the close. That persona does exist—and thrives—yet only in specific conditions. When the strategy actually demands patience, systems thinking, or heavy internal coordination, that same profile can work against the goal. The Luks Prisma Sales Model starts with strategy, not stereotype: it reads what you are trying to earn and then specifies which human patterns are most likely to earn it.

The model is built around five levels of revenue strategy. Retaining revenue from current customers is the bedrock. From there, organizations expand within current customers, acquire new customers for current offers, expand current customers with new offers, and finally pursue new customers with new offers. Each level has different risk, cycle time, learning curves, and collaboration demands—hence different ideal profiles.
## The Five Levels of Revenue Strategy
The first level is maintaining revenue from current customers—protecting the base through relationship quality and full-cycle delivery. The second is adding revenue from those same customers—systematically deepening share of wallet. The third pursues new customers using current products and markets—net-new logo acquisition where brand and offer are already proven. The fourth adds revenue from current customers with new products and new markets—co-developing and iterating with trusted accounts. The fifth pursues new customers with new products and new markets—the most complex and collaboration-intensive work, with dual learning curves in both offering and audience.
## The Six Dimensions of the Luks Prisma Sales Model
The model profiles sellers across six matched continua:

**Type (Hunter–Farmer).** Hunters are oriented to creating new relationships and opening demand; Farmers focus on nurturing, shaping, and expanding existing relationships.

**Style (Empirical–Methodical).** Empirical sellers operate from observation, experience, and fast experimentation; Methodical sellers operate from plans, structure, and disciplined follow-through.

**Intensity (Sprinter–Marathoner).** Sprinters optimize for speed and short-cycle effectiveness; Marathoners favor thoroughness and long-cycle effectiveness.

**Community (Individual–Group).** Individual-leaning sellers trust personal initiative; Group-leaning sellers anchor effort in team structures and shared commits.

**Role (Leader–Collaborator).** Leader-leaning profiles drive results through others; Collaborator-leaning profiles drive results primarily through their own hands-on work.

**Drive (Closer–Promoter).** Closers prioritize getting deals over the line; Promoters prioritize building durable relationships that compound into future wins.

Two notes guide application. First, there are no absolutes: most successful sellers blend both ends of each dimension across time. Second, two dimensions—Intensity and Role—are generally agnostic to revenue level and are set primarily by product characteristics (e.g., cycle length) and the specific team mandate.

## How the Dimensions Shift by Revenue Level

### Level 1 — Maintain Revenue from Current Customers
For revenue protection, the pattern tilts Farmer and Promoter: preserve satisfaction, anticipate needs, and put the relationship above any single deal. Community leans Group because continuity is a team sport across the full request-to-delivery cycle. The practical test here is whether the seller can coordinate others as well as perform directly.
### Level 2 — Add Revenue from Current Customers
To expand within existing accounts, the Type still leans Farmer but Drive adds more Closer—moving from service to systematic advancement of scope. Style leans Methodical: cadence, coverage, and follow-up beat charisma. Community remains Group because expansion depends on downstream delivery and cross-functional promises kept.
### Level 3 — Add Revenue from New Customers with Current Offers
This is the natural arena for Hunter + Closer—net-new logo acquisition when product/market are proven and speed matters. Style should be balanced: empirical instincts to open doors, method to scale repeatability. Community can tilt more Individual without being destructive—especially in field sales—yet leaders should plan explicit handoffs so the Level-3 profile doesn’t erode Level-1/2 relationship work once accounts enter the base.
### Level 4 — Add Revenue from Current Customers with New Offers
Here the seller must earn patience for iteration. Type should balance Hunter–Farmer to pair opportunity creation with care for existing trust. Drive leans Promoter, not hard close. Style leans Empirical—comfortable with ambiguity and learning cycles—while Community leans Group to mobilize the broader development and delivery team.
### Level 5 — Add Revenue from New Customers with New Offers
This is the highest-ambiguity work. Type again balances Hunter–Farmer to open doors while building relationships from scratch. Drive leans Promoter; Style leans Empirical; Community leans strongly Group because collaboration with product and implementation is continuous. Treat Level-5 profiles as enterprise builders who cultivate early markets, not just sellers.
## Practical Applications

### Hiring and Selection
Begin every search by naming the revenue level the role must primarily serve over the next 12–24 months. Use that level to set target leanings in Type and Drive, then confirm Style and Community fit to the account context. For Intensity, map the typical sales cycle and consequence of error: short, transactional cycles reward Sprinters; long, complex cycles reward Marathoners. Role should mirror the mandate: if the job is to orchestrate others, prioritize Leader; if it is to personally prospect and close, prioritize Collaborator. Calibrate that “default” with structured interviews and simulations that reveal how candidates trade off closing versus relationship signals in realistic scenarios.
### Team Design and Handoffs
Mixed portfolios rarely thrive with one monolithic profile. Staff deliberately to the seams: Level-3 hunters who are excellent openers, paired with Level-1/2 farmers who are excellent expanders and protectors. Write the handoff into the customer journey. A simple design principle helps: the person whose native pattern best matches the next strategic task should own the relationship at that moment. That prevents Level-3 aggression from damaging trust when an account shifts into Level-1/2 maintenance and expansion.
### Account Assignment and Pipeline Governance
Assign opportunities by fit, not fairness alone. New-logo sprints and event-driven blitzes go to Hunter–Closer Sprinters; multi-stakeholder enterprise pursuits go to balanced Type profiles with Group and Promoter leanings. For in-base expansion motions, favor Methodical Farmers who run coverage plays and orchestrate internal delivery to earn the right to ask for more. Review progression with two lenses: velocity where cycles are short, and quality of learning and stakeholder expansion where cycles are long.
### Incentives and Metrics
Compensation should echo the revenue level. For Level-3 motions, weight new-logo count and cycle time; for Level-1/2, weight retention, NPS/CSAT, and cross-sell depth; for Level-4/5, recognize validated learnings, milestone adoption, and multi-function collaboration in addition to revenue. Tie team incentives to Group-leaning work to reduce internal friction during delivery-heavy phases.
### Development and Mobility
Treat the six dimensions as a developmental map, not a verdict. Many sellers can shift leanings with coaching, design, and time. Farmers can learn structured close discipline; Hunters can learn to steward trust. The goal is *range with clarity*: make the current strategic need explicit, then help the seller widen their usable repertoire without forcing a permanent identity change.
### Product and Sales-Cycle Intensity
Two variables often determine Intensity and Role more than strategy level: the product’s complexity and the expected sales-cycle length. Short-cycle transactional offerings reward Sprinter intensity; complex, multi-month pursuits require Marathoner patience and more Leader expression to coordinate teams and stakeholders. Anchor these choices in the product and buying process you actually face; don’t mistake personal preference for structural fit.
## Implementation Steps
First, profile your revenue portfolio by level for the coming year so roles can be designed to fit real work. Second, define the “default lean” across the six dimensions for each role, with special attention to Type and Drive because they swing most with strategy level. Third, set explicit handoff rules in the customer journey so openers and expanders each have clear ownership windows. Fourth, interview and simulate against the specific dilemmas of the level (e.g., choosing relationship health over a quick deal at Level-1, or resisting over-closing at Level-4). Finally, measure outcomes that correspond to the work: protect and expand signals in base, open and velocity signals for new logos, learning and adoption signals for new-offer plays.
## Conclusion
Sales excellence is not a single personality; it is a match between human pattern and strategic task. The Luks Prisma Sales Model gives leaders a common language to make that match on purpose. By diagnosing your revenue level and then hiring, assigning, and rewarding to the six dimensions, you convert myth-based staffing into strategy-based design. Done well, this model raises win rates, reduces internal friction, and makes customer experience more coherent—because the right person is doing the right work at the right time.
