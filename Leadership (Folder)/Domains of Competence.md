# Aligning the Domains of Competence for Coherent Performance

## Excerpt  
Clarity on the Domains of Competence prevents organizations from mistaking present skill for future **potential**, or confusing reach and scale with strength in complexity. The three **Domains of Competence**—**Ability**, **Capability**, and **Capacity**—form a practical architecture for matching people and systems to the work at hand and the horizons ahead.

## Abstract  
Executives frequently conflate three distinct Domains of Competence: **Ability** (what can be executed now), **Capability** (how complexity is handled across time), and **Capacity** (how far and how widely Ability and Capability can be applied while preserving coherence). The result is mis-staffed initiatives, brittle scaling, and stalled strategy.

This paper defines each Domain precisely, explains their interdependence, and offers a working method to diagnose and align them. **Ability** is applied skill in the present. **Capability** is judgment and sense-making under uncertainty across expanding time horizons. **Capacity** is the scope, reach, and scale at which that Ability and Capability can be deployed through people, teams, and institutions without losing quality or alignment.

A cyclical operating practice—Design, Organize, Execute, Sustain—operationalizes the Domains of Competence. In the **DOES Leadership Model**, **Design** raises Capability, **Organize** extends Capacity, **Execute** expresses Ability, and **Sustain** renews all three. Levels of work and governance across time horizons provide scaffolding to match roles and oversight to the appropriate time span, ensuring the enterprise does not outgrow its **Capability depth** or attempt to operate at a scale its architecture cannot coherently support.

## Introduction  
Language discipline functions as an executive control point. When leaders call potential “Ability,” treat present skill as “Capability,” or use “Capacity” as a synonym for either, strategy drifts and talent decisions degrade. Precision restores coherence across staffing, sequencing, governance, and growth.

The definitions that follow separate these three Domains of Competence cleanly and show how they combine into a system of competence suitable for both day-to-day operations and multi-year transformation—especially as organizations extend reach across more people, geographies, and stakeholders.

## Defining the Three Domains of Competence  

### Ability — Present, Demonstrable Skill  
**Ability** is the practical skill and know-how to perform tasks effectively within a role **now**. It rests on applied knowledge, technique, and experience, and it shows up in repeatable execution, adherence to standards, and craft under feedback. Hiring for Ability ensures today’s work gets done with reliability. Development focuses on practice, coaching, and context-specific instruction. Measurement focuses on quality, speed, accuracy, and error rates within the current scope of responsibility.

### Capability — Judgment Under Complexity and Time  
**Capability** is the power to navigate complexity through judgment, sense-making, and meaning-making across time horizons. It reflects how individuals and organizations anticipate, decide, and adapt in uncertain contexts where problems are ambiguous, variables interact, and signals are noisy.

Role fit at higher levels of work depends primarily on Capability rather than Ability, because the work shifts from applying known methods to framing novel problems, selecting approaches, and orchestrating learning. As time span and uncertainty grow, Capability becomes the primary limiter of strategic altitude.

### Capacity — Scope, Reach, and Scale of Application  
**Capacity** is the scope, reach, and scale over which Ability and Capability can be effectively applied while preserving coherence, quality, and alignment. It answers a practical question: **how far, how wide, and through how many people and units can intent and judgment be deployed and sustained?**

Capacity is more than headcount or throughput. It is the application span of the other Domains of Competence: organizational design, layering, role architecture, communication channels, governance routines, data visibility, and cultural norms that allow direction and standards to travel intact through the system.

### Quick Discriminators in the Flow of Work  
- Time span, uncertainty, and judgment indicate **Capability**  
- Hands-on execution today indicates **Ability**  
- How far and how widely work can be applied and sustained indicates **Capacity**

## How the Domains of Competence Interlock  
Execution quality is bounded by **Ability**; strategic altitude is bounded by **Capability**; the scale at which strategy and standards can be applied coherently is bounded by **Capacity**. Raising one Domain while neglecting the others merely shifts the bottleneck.

As complexity increases, Capability must migrate from individuals into systems so that Capacity can extend it. Capacity represents the wider application of sound judgment and skill without reliance on constant heroics.

## The Operating System: DOES  
- **Design** elevates Capability by translating ambiguity into direction.  
- **Organize** converts intent into scalable Capacity.  
- **Execute** expresses Ability at the working edge.  
- **Sustain** renews all three Domains through foresight, resilience, and ethical continuity.

## Time, Complexity, and Governance  

### Governance Across Horizons  
Every enterprise must deliver present performance, lead transformation for the future, and steward identity over the enduring horizon.

Management, leadership, and stewardship are modes of contribution. Ability, Capability, and Capacity are Domains present in every mode. What changes is which Domain is emphasized and what it is in service of.

## Integrations With Adjacent Constructs  

### The Triad of Direction  
This mapping is not a one-to-one pairing: management, leadership, and stewardship each require Ability, Capability, and Capacity; the labels below indicate dominant emphasis, not exclusive ownership.

- **Management** governs **delivery**. It emphasizes reliable execution so Ability is expressed consistently, Capability is applied through sound trade-offs, and Capacity is allocated to sustain performance.  
- **Leadership** governs **direction**. It emphasizes judgment and alignment so Capability frames complexity, Ability is focused on what matters, and Capacity is mobilized for change.  
- **Stewardship** governs continuity and guardianship. It emphasizes protection and advancement of what is valuable across time—identity, ethics, standards, and legitimacy—so Capacity is grown and used without erosion of coherence.


Each leg of the triad carries all three Domains; the distinction is the governing aim: delivery (management), direction (leadership), and continuity/guardianship (stewardship).

Strategic balance across the triad ensures that as organizational reach grows, the Domains of Competence grow with it—without category collapse.

## Conclusion  
Competence is not a single attribute but a system of three interdependent Domains of Competence. **Ability** delivers the present, **Capability** navigates complexity across time, and **Capacity** determines how far and how widely both can be applied without loss of coherence.

Leaders who design for all three—using disciplined language, horizon-aware governance, and operating practices aligned to each Domain—build organizations that remain reliable as they scale and renewable as conditions change.
