## Excerpt  
Clarity on the Domains of Competence prevents organizations from mistaking present skill for future potential, or reach and scale for strength in complexity. The three **Domains of Competence**—**ability**, **capability**, and **capacity**—form a practical architecture for matching people and systems to the work at hand and the horizons ahead.

## Abstract  
Executives frequently conflate three distinct **Domains of Competence**: **ability** (what can be executed now), **capability** (how complexity is handled across time), and **capacity** (how far and how widely ability and capability can be applied while preserving coherence). The result is mis-staffed initiatives, brittle scaling, and stalled strategy.  

This white paper defines each Domain of Competence precisely, explains their interdependence, and offers a working method to diagnose and align them. **Ability** is applied skill in the present. **Capability** is judgment and sense-making under uncertainty across expanding time horizons. **Capacity** is the scope, reach, and scale at which that ability and capability can be deployed through people, teams, and institutions without losing quality or alignment.  

A cyclical leadership practice—Design, Organize, Execute, Sustain—operationalizes the Domains of Competence: **Design** raises capability, **Organize** extends capacity by building scalable reach, **Execute** expresses ability, and **Sustain** renews all three. Levels of work and governance across time horizons provide scaffolding to match roles and oversight to the appropriate time span. Leaders can use this model to calibrate hiring, development, operating design, and board practice, ensuring the enterprise does not outgrow its cognitive depth or attempt to operate at a scale its architecture cannot coherently support.

## Introduction  
Language discipline functions as an executive control point. When leaders call potential “ability,” treat present skill as “capability,” or use “capacity” as a synonym for either, strategy drifts and talent decisions degrade. Precision restores coherence across staffing, sequencing, governance, and growth.  

The definitions that follow separate these three **Domains of Competence** cleanly and show how they combine into a system of competence suitable for both day-to-day operations and multi-year transformation—especially as organizations seek to extend their reach across more people, geographies, and stakeholders.

## Defining the Three Domains of Competence  

### Ability — Present, Demonstrable Skill  
Ability is the practical skill and know-how to perform tasks effectively within a role **now**. It rests on applied knowledge, technique, and experience, and it shows up in repeatable execution, adherence to standards, and craft under feedback. Hiring for ability ensures today’s work gets done with reliability. Development at this level focuses on practice, coaching, and context-specific instruction. Measurement focuses on quality, speed, accuracy, and error rates within the current scope of responsibility.

### Capability — Judgment Under Complexity and Time  
Capability is the capacity to handle increasing complexity across time horizons. It reflects judgment, sense-making, and potential beyond immediate tasks. Capability determines how individuals and organizations anticipate, decide, and adapt in uncertain contexts where problems are ambiguous, variables interact, and signals are noisy.  

Role fit at higher levels of work depends primarily on capability rather than ability, because the work shifts from applying known methods to framing novel problems, selecting approaches, and orchestrating learning. As time span and uncertainty grow, capability becomes the primary limiter of strategic altitude.

### Capacity — Scope, Reach, and Scale of Application  
Capacity is the scope, reach, and scale over which ability and capability can be effectively applied while preserving coherence, quality, and alignment. It answers the question: **how far, how wide, and through how many people and units can intent and judgment be deployed and sustained?**  

A founder may have the capability to design a sound strategy but only the capacity to apply it through a 20-person team in one location. A Fortune 100 CEO must apply comparable or greater capability through thousands of leaders and over 100,000 employees across regions, cultures, and regulators.  

Capacity is not only headcount or throughput. It is the **application span** of the other Domains of Competence: organizational design, layering, role architecture, communication channels, governance routines, data visibility, and cultural norms that allow direction and standards to travel intact through the system.

### Quick Discriminators in the Flow of Work  
Time span, uncertainty, and judgment indicate **capability**; hands-on execution today indicates **ability**; how **far and how wide** work can be applied and sustained indicates **capacity**. These fast tests prevent common category errors in performance reviews and workforce planning and guide targeted interventions that solve the real constraint within the Domains of Competence.

## How the Domains of Competence Interlock  

### A Simple Physics of Performance  
Execution quality is bounded by **ability**; strategic altitude is bounded by **capability**; **the scale at which strategy and standards can be applied coherently is bounded by capacity**. Raising one Domain of Competence while neglecting the others simply moves the bottleneck.  

A team with strong ability but insufficient capacity can deliver quality locally yet fails when asked to roll out the same work across regions. A firm with abundant capacity but shallow capability scales the wrong thing faster. A leader with strong capability but weak personal ability struggles when judgment must be expressed through unfamiliar tools or contexts at critical moments.

### Individual Strength Depends on Institutional Scaffolding  
Individual capacity is limited until organizational capacity extends it. A skilled founder can personally hold the whole system in mind when the company is small. As the system grows, personal oversight cannot scale; reach must be extended through roles, mechanisms, and culture.  

Star performers stall in low-structure environments once the organization grows beyond the radius they can personally influence. Their ability and capability do not automatically translate into broader capacity. Average performers excel in well-designed systems because capacity multiplies their ability and carries direction further with less distortion. System design acts as a multiplier on the visible competence and effective reach of the Domains of Competence.

### From Person to System  
At lower complexity, **ability** dominates performance because reach is limited: small teams, short cycles, direct oversight. As complexity and time span increase, **capability** becomes decisive—but only if it **migrates** from individuals into systems so that **capacity** can extend it.  

That migration embeds insight in principles, decision rights, shared methods, and cultural norms, so that coherent decisions can be made at greater distance from the original source of judgment. Capacity then represents not just “more of the same work,” but **wider application of sound judgment and skill** across geographies, layers, and functions without relying on constant heroics from a few individuals.

## The Operating System: DOES as a Practice for the Domains of Competence  

### Design Elevates Capability  
Design translates ambiguity into direction. Sensing, analysis, risk reasoning, and goal alignment increase the organization’s capability to handle longer horizons and higher complexity. High-quality design clarifies assumptions, makes trade-offs explicit, and embeds learning loops so that new information updates intent. The practical output is a portfolio of choices with rationale, constraints, and decision rights that can be communicated and held by others.

### Organize Converts Intent Into Scalable Capacity  
Organize aligns people, processes, resources, and systems so that intent can be applied across a broader span. Good organization replaces fragmentation with collaboration and turns direction into coordinated, repeatable application at scale.  

Operating models, role architectures, planning cadences, and cross-functional interfaces are the instruments of capacity creation. They determine how far a strategy can travel while remaining recognizable. Visibility into work-in-progress, decision rights, and resource allocation prevents silent overloads and reduces the oscillation that consumes capacity without extending reach.

### Execute Expresses Ability at the Working Edge  
Execute transforms intent into outcomes through operational discipline, accountability, and problem solving. This is the proving ground for **ability**—craft under feedback, rhythm, and pressure—supported by the capacity and guardrails created upstream.  

Standard work, escalation protocols, and tight feedback loops allow individual ability to compound and to be **replicated** across teams, rather than remaining local and idiosyncratic. Execution quality at the edge reveals whether capacity has been designed well enough to carry intent intact.

### Sustain Renews All Three Domains of Competence  
Sustain embeds foresight, resilience, and change discipline so that capability continues to grow and capacity does not erode under success or stress. Renewal practices include retrospectives, failure-tolerant learning, reliability engineering, and attention to culture and ethics.  

Done well, Sustain increases both the depth of capability and the confidence with which it can be applied at larger scales, while refreshing the ability base. The result is consistent performance with room for reinvention rather than stagnation or fragility.

## Time, Complexity, and Role Fit  

### Levels of Work as the Capability Ladder  
Work increases in scale, scope, and time span from short-cycle quality tasks to multi-year strategic design and institutional stewardship. Placing people where their capability matches the level’s complexity prevents both under-challenge (boredom, disengagement) and over-stretch (failure, defensiveness).  

Development planning should therefore map the next capability horizon, identify the judgment patterns required, and create safe but real situations in which to practice them. As leaders move up the ladder, their individual capacity must also evolve—from directly holding a small team to shaping systems that carry their intent across many teams, extending the Domains of Competence through design rather than personal heroics.

### Governance Across Horizons as the Oversight Lens  
Every enterprise must deliver present performance, lead transformation for the near future, and steward identity over the enduring horizon. Governance should align management (present), leadership (future), and stewardship (enduring) so that the Domains of Competence are balanced across time.  

Operating reviews, transformation councils, and board-level stewardship discussions distribute attention and decision rights where they matter most for the relevant horizon. As organizations grow, governance becomes a primary mechanism through which capacity—scope and reach of application—is extended without losing integrity.

## Common Failure Modes and How to Correct Them  

### Mistaking Ability for Capability  
Promoting the best practitioner into a role that requires sense-making under uncertainty confuses present skill with future judgment. Correction requires assessment of capability against the role’s time span and complexity, not just a résumé of wins. Practically, this means evaluating how candidates frame ambiguous problems, decompose interactions, and design feedback loops, not only how they perform known tasks.

### Treating Capacity Problems as Performance Problems  
Overloaded teams with sound methods and solid ability often suffer from structural capacity gaps: the organization is asking strategy and standards to be applied across a reach it was not designed to support. Symptoms include chronic rework at interfaces, dropped handoffs between units, and inconsistent decisions across regions.  

The remedy is redesign—governance, interfaces, layering, and resource allocation—before coaching or replacement. Interventions should first narrow or clarify scope, align decision rights with capability, and then selectively expand capacity so that the same intent can be applied at a realistic scale.

### Scaling Without Institutional Capability  
Rapid hiring and tooling can increase apparent capacity—more people, more sites—while leaving decision quality unchanged. Without design discipline and shared standards, the system amplifies noise.  

Building capability into the architecture—principles, decision rights, orientation to risk, and standard decision processes—allows capacity to grow without diluting judgment. Capacity then means not just a larger footprint, but a **larger footprint governed by coherent thinking** across all three Domains of Competence.

### Over-Reliance on Heroics  
Heroic effort can mask system defects that limit capacity and distort capability development. When reach depends on a few leaders personally “holding” the whole organization, growth stalls or collapses when they are absent.  

Sustainable performance emerges when the system assumes normal human variability and builds margin, automation, and clarity so that excellence and reach are achieved by design, not by sacrifice. Capacity, in this sense, is the degree to which the organization can act coherently **without** constant exceptional effort.

## A Practical Method for Leaders  

### Name the Work and the Horizon  
Specify the nature of work, the dominant uncertainty, and the required time span. This anchors whether capability or ability is the primary selection criterion and how much capacity—in scope and reach—is actually needed. A simple charter with purpose, measures of success, constraints, and horizon clarifies selection and design choices across the Domains of Competence.

### Diagnose the Current Bottleneck  
Observe whether outcomes fail due to skill gaps (ability), judgment and framing under ambiguity (capability), or the **scale at which intent is being applied** (capacity). Use the quick discriminators in real incidents and in routine reviews. Ask which constraint, if relieved, would most improve outcomes within the next horizon: sharper craft, deeper judgment, or more coherent reach.

### Intervene Through DOES  
Improve framing, risk posture, and learning loops to raise capability in **Design**. Align roles, flow, and structures to extend capacity in **Organize**—not only to do more, but to apply intent further with less distortion. Coach craft, decisions, and feedback to sharpen ability in **Execute**. Embed resilience, renewal, and long-view ethics so gains persist in **Sustain**.  

Cycling through DOES at multiple cadences—weekly for operations, quarterly for strategy—ensures each Domain of Competence receives attention at the right frequency.

### Govern Across Horizons  
Tie quarterly performance to the present horizon, transformation agendas to the future horizon, and mission, culture, and reputation to the enduring horizon. Metrics and incentives should reflect this distribution of attention. Boards and executives should explicitly reserve time and resources for enduring stewardship so that short-term wins do not compromise long-term coherence or tempt the organization to operate at a scale its architecture cannot reliably support.

## Integrations With Adjacent Constructs  

### Progression of Meaningful Response  
Sense-making and meaning-making precede framing and solving; **capability** expresses most in the first two disciplines, **ability** in solving, and **capacity** in the system’s ability to **carry and apply** solutions at broader scale. Designing organizations to support the full progression—sensing, interpreting, deciding, executing—raises overall competence and shortens the loop between learning and action.

### The Triad of Direction  
Management delivers reliability in known systems (ability in action), leadership sets direction amid change (capability in action), and stewardship safeguards identity across time (capacity governed for legacy and scale). Strategic balance across the triad sustains institutional coherence and ensures that as the organization’s reach grows, its Domains of Competence grow with it.

## Conclusion  
Competence is not a single line item; it is a **system** of three interdependent **Domains of Competence** that must be named, measured, and managed with discipline. **Ability** delivers the present by applying known methods with craft and precision. **Capability** navigates complexity across time by framing, deciding, and learning under uncertainty. **Capacity** determines **how far and how widely** the enterprise can carry both without losing coherence or exhausting its people.  

Leaders who design for all three Domains of Competence—using DOES as the practice, levels of work and horizon-based governance as scaffolds, and a shared language to avoid category errors—create organizations that remain reliable as they scale and renewable as conditions change. The payoff is strategic agility with operational steadiness: a firm that can apply sound judgment and strong execution across a growing footprint, for longer.
