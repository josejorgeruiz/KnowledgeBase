## Excerpt
A practical bridge between sales style and leadership strength: for each Prisma pole, this map highlights four DOES competencies that amplify advantages, prevent overreach, and build flexible range across contexts.
## A Reflective Mapping
The Luks Prisma Sales Model looks at selling through six “either/or” dimensions—Type, Style, Intensity, Community, Role, and Drive. Each dimension has two poles, but the point isn’t to label people permanently. It’s to notice where someone naturally leans—and how that leaning can shift depending on context, pressure, and what the moment calls for.

The DOES Leadership Model (Design, Organize, Execute, Sustain) complements this by offering a clear set of leadership competencies that translate intention into structure, structure into results, and results into long-term durability.

What follows is a practical, reflective mapping: for each of the 12 poles, I’ve selected the four DOES competencies that best (1) strengthen the pole’s upside, (2) guard against its most common overreach, and (3) build enough flexibility to draw from the opposite pole when strategy, customer reality, or operating conditions require a shift.

# Mapping the Luks Prisma Sales Dimension Poles to DOES Competencies

According to a document from **2025-12-06**, the Luks Prisma Sales Model defines six bipolar sales dimensions—Type, Style, Intensity, Community, Role, and Drive—each expressed as a *leaning* toward one of two poles rather than a fixed identity. The Glossary further emphasizes that poles should be spoken about directionally (“X-leaning,” “shifts toward Y under pressure”), not categorically.  

According to a document from **2025-10-19**, the DOES Leadership Model (Design, Organize, Execute, Sustain) offers 24 competencies (6 per role) that collectively link intent to structure, structure to outcomes, and outcomes to renewal.

What follows is a “deep reflection” mapping: for **each of the 12 poles**, I identify the **top four DOES competencies** that most strongly (1) amplify the pole’s advantage, (2) reduce its most common over-extension risks, and (3) increase the seller’s flexibility to draw from the opposite pole when the revenue strategy, customer condition, or operating environment demands it.

## A Note on Interpretation

In practice, the Prisma poles describe *selling orientation under pressure*—how a person tends to trade off speed vs. thoroughness, autonomy vs. orchestration, closure vs. long-term compounding, and so on. The DOES competencies describe *end-to-end practice across a cycle*: design choices, organize the system, execute with discipline, and sustain renewal.

So the mapping is not “Hunters should only learn Design” or “Farmers only need Organize.” Instead, each pole implies a **recurring operating dilemma**, and the chosen competencies are the best “counterweights” and “accelerants” for that dilemma.

## Dimension 1: Type (Hunter–Farmer)

The Type dimension contrasts creating new relationships/opening demand vs. nurturing/expanding existing relationships.

### Hunter-Leaning

**Top Four DOES Competencies:** External Awareness, Innovative Thinking, Decision-Making Agility, Risk Management.

Hunter-leaning selling is fundamentally about *finding signal in noise* and acting before certainty is available. External Awareness is the sensing mechanism—seeing shifts in buyers, competitors, timing, and category narratives early enough to matter. Innovative Thinking converts that sensing into differentiated angles, unexpected entry points, and fresh packaging of value. Decision-Making Agility keeps the hunter from getting trapped in analysis while the window closes.

The hidden fragility of the Hunter pole is the tendency to confuse momentum with inevitability. That’s where Risk Management becomes essential—not to slow the hunter into paralysis, but to keep speed from turning into sloppy qualification, reputational damage, or “spray-and-pray” pipeline inflation. When Hunter-leaning sellers pair speed with risk discipline, they become consistently courageous rather than intermittently lucky.

### Farmer-Leaning

**Top Four DOES Competencies:** Stakeholder Management, Cross-Functional Collaboration, Goal Alignment, Accountability.

Farmer-leaning selling is about *compounding trust* and *expanding share of wallet* through continuity. Stakeholder Management is the core relational engine: it’s the difference between “having a champion” and holding a durable coalition across functions and levels. Cross-Functional Collaboration is equally central because expansion is rarely a solo act; it depends on delivery, product, support, finance, and operations behaving coherently around promises.

Goal Alignment ensures the farmer doesn’t become purely reactive to customer requests. It anchors the account into a shared path of outcomes and milestones rather than a stream of favors. Accountability closes the loop: farmers win by being believed, and being believed requires that commitments are honored and visible.

## Dimension 2: Style (Empirical–Methodical)

Style contrasts fast experimentation from observation/experience vs. plans, structure, and disciplined follow-through.

### Empirical-Leaning

**Top Four DOES Competencies:** External Awareness, Innovative Thinking, Decision-Making Agility, Problem Solving.

Empirical-leaning sellers learn in motion. Their gift is rapid iteration: try, observe, adjust—especially valuable in ambiguity-heavy contexts (new offers, new markets, unclear buying processes). External Awareness supplies real-time “field data.” Innovative Thinking generates alternative hypotheses (new talk tracks, new stakeholder angles, new use cases). Decision-Making Agility keeps experiments small, fast, and frequent rather than overdesigned.

The failure mode is often *thrash*—constant motion without cumulative learning. Problem Solving is the competency that turns experimentation into progress by pushing beyond surface symptoms to root causes: why messaging isn’t landing, why stakeholders stall, why pilots don’t convert. With strong Problem Solving, empirical energy becomes a learning system rather than a personality trait.

### Methodical-Leaning

**Top Four DOES Competencies:** Analytical Decision-Making, Project Management, Operational Excellence, Risk Management.

Methodical-leaning sellers scale reliability. Analytical Decision-Making provides the evidence discipline: qualification rigor, deal math, sequencing logic, and the ability to separate “interesting” from “important.” Project Management turns complex pursuits into coordinated timelines, dependencies, and stakeholder actions—especially in multi-month enterprise sales.

Operational Excellence is the methodical seller’s quiet superpower: consistent cadences, clean CRM hygiene, repeatable plays, and reduced friction across the funnel. Risk Management matters here because methodical systems can still fail if they assume stability where none exists; it keeps the plan honest by continuously checking volatility, deal fragility, and dependency risk.

## Dimension 3: Intensity (Sprinter–Marathoner)

Intensity contrasts short-cycle speed vs. long-cycle thoroughness. The Sales Model also notes that Intensity is often shaped by sales-cycle length and product complexity, not just personal preference.

### Sprinter-Leaning

**Top Four DOES Competencies:** Decision-Making Agility, Accountability, Operational Excellence, Goal Alignment.

Sprinter-leaning sellers win by compressing cycle time without collapsing quality. Decision-Making Agility is the obvious driver: fast choices, fast next steps, fast tradeoffs. But speed without credibility becomes noise, so Accountability is non-negotiable—sprinters must be trusted because they ask buyers to move quickly.

Operational Excellence prevents sprinting from becoming chaos; it’s what makes high-velocity selling repeatable across many deals. Goal Alignment is the compass that keeps sprinters from chasing every fast-looking opportunity; it forces clarity on “the few moves that matter,” especially under quota pressure.

### Marathoner-Leaning

**Top Four DOES Competencies:** Project Management, Performance Management, Stakeholder Management, Organizational Resilience.

Marathoner-leaning selling is built for complexity: multiple stakeholders, long buying cycles, and high consequence of error. Project Management is the structural backbone—marathoners must coordinate time, decisions, and dependencies across months. Stakeholder Management becomes more sophisticated here because enterprise deals stall less from “no need” and more from misalignment, politics, competing priorities, and fear of change.

Performance Management keeps a long pursuit from drifting into “activity without progress.” It forces leading indicators, stage integrity, and evidence-based forecasting. Organizational Resilience matters because long cycles inevitably include setbacks—champions leave, budgets freeze, initiatives get reprioritized. Resilience is what keeps the pursuit coherent when the environment destabilizes.

## Dimension 4: Community (Individual–Group)

Community contrasts trusting personal initiative vs. anchoring effort in team structures and shared commitments. The Sales Model highlights how Group leaning often matters for continuity and delivery-heavy work.

### Individual-Leaning

**Top Four DOES Competencies:** Accountability, Decision-Making Agility, Analytical Decision-Making, Communication.

Individual-leaning sellers create velocity through autonomy. That autonomy becomes productive rather than reckless through Accountability—the willingness to own outcomes without hiding behind the system. Decision-Making Agility supports independent navigation when supervision is light and conditions change quickly.

The risk is “solo hero” logic: intuition untethered from evidence and a tendency to over-trust personal pattern recognition. Analytical Decision-Making keeps autonomy rigorous: it forces hypotheses to face data. Communication matters because individual initiative still must translate into alignment with customers, leaders, and delivery teams; high autonomy with low communication creates downstream damage.

### Group-Leaning

**Top Four DOES Competencies:** Cross-Functional Collaboration, Culture Building, Stakeholder Management, Communication.

Group-leaning sellers treat selling as a coordinated system. Cross-Functional Collaboration is the operating method: orchestrating product, implementation, support, legal, security, finance, and leadership around the pursuit. Culture Building is the multiplier because group selling collapses when the environment rewards blame, silos, or heroics; culture building creates norms of shared ownership and mutual reliability.

Stakeholder Management operates on two fronts here: external buyer coalitions and internal coalitions that must deliver. Communication is the glue competency—without clear narrative, crisp handoffs, and expectation-setting, “team selling” becomes diffusion of responsibility rather than leverage.

## Dimension 5: Role (Orchestrator–Collaborator)

Role contrasts driving results through others vs. primarily through one’s own hands-on work. The Sales Model also notes Role is often determined by mandate: orchestrate others vs. personally prospect and close.

### Orchestrator-Leaning

**Top Four DOES Competencies:** Talent Alignment, Resource Management, Stakeholder Management, Leadership Development.

Orchestrator-leaning sellers multiply outcomes through people and systems. Talent Alignment ensures the right strengths are positioned against the right work (who opens, who expands, who runs technical validation, who manages exec relationships). Resource Management ensures time, executive attention, specialists, and budget are deployed where they change the probability of win.

Stakeholder Management is central because orchestrators operate across influence networks rather than direct control—especially in matrixed orgs. Leadership Development makes this pole sustainable: if success depends on a few orchestrators, the system becomes brittle. Developing others creates bench strength, reduces single points of failure, and prevents the orchestrator from becoming an overworked bottleneck.

### Collaborator-Leaning

**Top Four DOES Competencies:** Operational Excellence, Problem Solving, Accountability, Communication.

Collaborator-leaning sellers win through direct contribution: doing the craft, driving tasks themselves, and staying close to the work. Operational Excellence makes that craft reliable—tight follow-through, strong personal pipeline discipline, and high-quality execution without constant coordination overhead.

Problem Solving is critical because hands-on sellers are usually closest to friction; they either become the team’s repair engine or they burn out complaining. Accountability ensures collaborators don’t externalize failure (“support didn’t…,” “product didn’t…”) but instead convert constraints into owned strategies. Communication prevents a common collaborator trap: working hard in silence while stakeholders remain misaligned about progress, needs, and next actions.

## Dimension 6: Drive (Closer–Promoter)

Drive contrasts prioritizing getting deals over the line vs. building durable relationships that compound into future wins. The Sales Model explicitly notes that different revenue levels pull Drive toward different poles (e.g., Level 1 retention tilts Promoter; Level 3 new logos often tilts Closer).

### Closer-Leaning

**Top Four DOES Competencies:** Goal Alignment, Accountability, Decision-Making Agility, Risk Management.

Closer-leaning selling is the discipline of commitment: moving from “interested” to “decided.” Goal Alignment ensures closing energy is aimed at the right outcome (and the right deal) rather than simply any deal. Accountability is the integrity layer: closing pressure can tempt shortcutting, overpromising, or manipulating urgency; accountability keeps the close clean and credible.

Decision-Making Agility supports crisp sequencing: when to push, when to pause, when to escalate, when to trade, when to walk. Risk Management reduces the classic closer failure mode: “winning” deals that later churn, collapse in implementation, or damage long-term trust. Strong closers don’t just increase win rate; they increase *healthy* win rate.

### Promoter-Leaning

**Top Four DOES Competencies:** Stakeholder Management, Communication, Foresight and Scenario Planning, Sustainability Thinking.

Promoter-leaning sellers play the long game: trust, continuity, and reputation as compounding assets. Stakeholder Management is the obvious core—promoters build durable coalitions and protect relationships across time and turbulence. Communication matters because long-term trust is built through clarity: setting expectations, narrating tradeoffs, naming constraints, and preventing surprises.

Foresight and Scenario Planning is what keeps promoters from becoming purely “nice” and reactive. It enables anticipation: where the customer’s world is heading, what risks are emerging, what new needs will surface, and how to shape an agenda that makes the relationship strategically indispensable. Sustainability Thinking adds an ethical and systemic dimension: it frames value beyond the immediate transaction, helping promoters build partnerships that endure because they create responsible outcomes and protect the broader ecosystem of trust.

## Cross-Dimension Reflection: The Hidden Pattern

Across all 12 poles, a consistent pattern emerges:

### The Prisma Poles Describe “Where Value Comes From”

Hunters generate value through new demand; farmers through compounding trust. Empiricals generate value through learning speed; methodicals through repeatability. Sprinters generate value through cycle compression; marathoners through complexity endurance. Individuals generate value through autonomy; groups through orchestration. Orchestrators generate value through leverage; collaborators through direct craft. Closers generate value through decision and commitment; promoters through relationship compounding.

### The DOES Competencies Describe “How to Keep That Value Healthy Over Time”

The most useful competencies for each pole are rarely the ones that merely “increase” the pole. They are the ones that prevent the pole from becoming self-defeating—turning speed into sloppiness, autonomy into isolation, thoroughness into stagnation, relationship into avoidance, or closing into reputational debt.

That is why this mapping repeatedly pairs:

- **Speed poles** (Hunter, Empirical, Sprinter, Closer) with **Risk Management, Accountability, and Goal Alignment**.  
- **Trust/continuity poles** (Farmer, Marathoner, Group, Promoter) with **Stakeholder Management, Collaboration, and Performance/Project discipline**.  
- **Orchestration poles** (Group, Orchestrator, Marathoner) with **Resource/Talent alignment** and **Leadership Development**, to avoid dependency on a single “quarterback.”  
- **Autonomy poles** (Individual, Collaborator) with **Communication**, to prevent downstream fragmentation.

### The Practical Payoff: Range With Clarity

One of the most important lines in the Sales Model is that “there are no absolutes” and that strong sellers blend both ends across time. In practical terms, the goal is not to “move everyone to the middle.” The goal is to build **controlled range**: you can lean where you’re strongest, while having the DOES competencies to shift when the strategy level, customer reality, or product complexity demands it.
