Decision-making fundamentally rests on two key dimensions: knowledge and control—what you know versus what you don’t know, and what you can control versus what you can’t control. These dimensions help frame the decision landscape into four distinct quadrants:

1. Known and Controlled: This is the space of operational clarity. You have the information, and you have the authority or means to act on it. Decisions here are often routine or tactical—relying on established processes, best practices, and past experience.

2. Known but Uncontrolled: You understand the situation, but you lack the ability to influence it directly. This may include market trends, competitor moves, or regulatory changes. Decision-making in this space focuses on adaptation, contingency planning, or collaboration with those who do have influence.

3. Unknown but Controllable: This is the space of learning and innovation. You don’t currently know, but you could know—and once you do, you can act. It requires exploration, experimentation, and sometimes investment in acquiring new capabilities or insights.

4. Unknown and Uncontrolled: This is the realm of risk, uncertainty, and emergence. You lack both information and control. It requires resilience, awareness, and the ability to respond quickly as things become clearer. This quadrant is common in crisis situations or when navigating highly volatile environments.

While decisions are often treated as discrete moments—a single choice at a point in time—real decision-making is usually iterative and layered. Most decisions are nested within other decisions, creating a sequence where each choice informs or reframes the next. This recursive process blends two types of decision environments:

• Complicated decisions, where the relationship between cause and effect can be analyzed and understood through data, models, and experience.

• Complex decisions, where outcomes are unpredictable, and variables interact in dynamic ways. These require sensing, responding, and adapting under VUCA conditions: volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity.

This back-and-forth between complicated and complex decision-making builds a mosaic—a puzzle assembled piece by piece. Each decision contributes context and clarity, enabling the next layer of decisions. Over time, this creates a structure for decision-making that grows in confidence, insight, and intent.

The management horizon defines how far into the future a person can responsibly make and execute decisions without immediate feedback or certainty. It reflects not only a leader’s comfort with ambiguity and delayed results but also their capacity to hold strategic intent over time. The longer the horizon, the greater the demand for foresight, accountability, and judgment in the absence of clear signals. Understanding your own management horizon—and that of your team—is essential to aligning roles, responsibilities, and expectations across different layers of decision-making.

Herbert A. Simon’s Administrative Behavior (1947) provides foundational insights into how bounded rationality influences both what decision-makers can know (knowledge constraints) and how they can act (control constraints). Simon underscores that decision-making occurs under limited information and within structures of authority, aligning with the “known” versus “unknown” and “controlled” versus “uncontrolled” dimensions.

Dave Snowden and Mary E. Boone’s “A Leader’s Framework for Decision Making” in Harvard Business Review (2007) introduces the Cynefin framework, distinguishing between simple, complicated, complex, and chaotic contexts. Their perspective supports the iterative nature of decision-making, where complicated decisions can be analyzed through data and models, while complex decisions must be navigated through experimentation and adaptation—key elements in the text’s distinction between “complicated” and “complex.

Karl E. Weick’s Sensemaking in Organizations (1995) reinforces the importance of iterative decision processes in unpredictable environments. Weick highlights how individuals and groups construct meaning through continuous interaction, linking directly to how the “unknown and uncontrolled” space can be managed via organizational sensemaking and learning.

The concept of VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) originates from the U.S. Army War College (late 1990s) and parallels the “unknown and uncontrolled” quadrant. VUCA frames the challenges leaders face when navigating emerging crises or highly volatile environments, requiring resilience, awareness, and ongoing adaptation.

Chris Argyris and Donald A. Schön’s Organizational Learning: A Theory of Action Perspective (1978) explains single- and double-loop learning, which underpins how organizations transition from “unknown but controllable” situations to “known and controlled” ones through iterative learning and feedback loops. Their work supports the notion of incremental discovery and adaptation over time.

Henry Mintzberg’s The Rise and Fall of Strategic Planning (1994) and “Crafting Strategy” in Harvard Business Review (1987) illustrate how strategy emerges over a series of decisions rather than in one discrete moment. Mintzberg’s emphasis on continuous sense-and-respond approaches dovetails with the idea that real decision-making is layered and unfolds iteratively, shaping and reshaping strategic intent.

Peter M. Senge’s The Fifth Discipline (1990) offers insight into how system thinking and long-term perspectives affect a leader’s “management horizon.” Senge’s focus on seeing interrelationships and patterns over time supports the argument that extending one’s horizon demands greater foresight, accountability, and comfort with ambiguity—core principles in understanding the longer-term, strategic layers of decision-making.
