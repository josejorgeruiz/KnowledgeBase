## Instruction

Treat the **Glossary** as the authoritative source. The Domains of Competence terms **Ability**, **Capability**, and **Capacity** are **reserved words** and must only be used with the Glossary meanings below.

---

## Decision rule

### 1. Detect target terms
Detect (case-insensitive):
- “ability”, “abilities”
- “capability”, “capabilities”
- “capacity”, “capacities”

### 2. Check meaning against the glossary
Use these meanings (no substitutions):

- **Ability** = practical skill and know-how to perform tasks effectively within a given role; grounded in applied knowledge, skills, and experience; what can be reliably executed in the present.
- **Capability** = power to navigate complexity through judgment, sense-making, and meaning-making across individual, organizational, and institutional layers; sustaining coherence, direction, and resilience over time.
- **Capacity** = scope, reach, and scale over which Ability and Capability can be applied **while preserving coherence**.

### 3. Decide what to do
- **KEEP the term choice** (do not swap Ability/Capability/Capacity) when the usage aligns with the Glossary meaning.
  - You **may** still rewrite for clarity/conciseness (e.g., remove “has the ability to…”), as long as intent, scope, tense, and polarity are preserved.
- **CHANGE** when the usage clearly does **not** align with the Glossary meaning:
  - Prefer an **active-verb rewrite** that removes the misused term.
  - If the sentence clearly points to one of the other two meanings, you may **swap to the correct term** instead of rewriting—only when that swap makes the sentence strictly Glossary-correct.

## Do-not-change exemplars (canonical)

Do not modify these examples; they demonstrate correct application and expected rewrite patterns.

- “She has the ability to influence senior stakeholders.” → “She influences senior stakeholders.”
- “He has the capability to manage global programs.” → “He manages global programs and orchestrates vendors.”
- “They have the capacity to take more accounts.” → “They have bandwidth to take five more enterprise accounts.”

---

## How to change when usage is incorrect

### Preferred: active-verb rewrites (default)
Remove the misused reserved term and express the claim as observable action, outcome, or operating behavior.

### Allowed: term swap (only when clearly correct)
Swap Ability/Capability/Capacity only when the sentence’s intended meaning is unambiguous and matches the Glossary definition of the replacement term.

## Quick rewrite templates

- **Ability misused for complexity across time horizons** → replace with **Capability** or rewrite actively.
  - “has the ability to set multi-year direction” → “has the capability to set multi-year direction”
  - or → “sets direction across multi-year horizons.”

- **Capability misused for present-tense skill** → replace with **Ability** or active verb.
  - “has the capability to code in Python” → “has the ability to code in Python”
  - or → “codes in Python.”

- **Capacity misused for skill or judgment** → use scope/scale/bandwidth language (and avoid implying “skill”).
  - “has the capacity to learn quickly” → “shows aptitude for rapid learning.”
  - “has the capacity for five more clients” → “has bandwidth for five more clients.”

## Alternative wording menu (use when changing)

- **Demonstrated skill (now):** proficient at, skilled at, fluent in, adept at, delivers, executes, produces
- **Readiness & fit:** equipped to, positioned to, well-suited to, ready to
- **Potential & trajectory:** shows promise in, has aptitude for, emerging strength in, on track to
- **Scope & complexity (instead of misusing “capability”):** navigates, orchestrates, sustains, integrates, governs, frames trade-offs
- **Throughput/scale (instead of misusing “capacity”):** bandwidth for, headroom for, room to take on, coverage for, can absorb

---

## Operational checks

- **Ambiguity rule:** if context is ambiguous but plausibly aligns with the Glossary meaning, **do not swap terms**. You may optionally rewrite for clarity without changing intent.
- **Semantics guardrail:** preserve original intent, scope, subject, tense, and polarity when changing.
- **No inflation:** do not add strength modifiers (e.g., “world-class”) unless present in the source.
- **Consistency:** apply the same decision rule across comparable sentences within the same document.

## Fast tests to choose the right concept

- Mentions judgment under uncertainty, meaning-making, coherence across layers, or longer time horizons → **Capability**.
- Describes hands-on execution that can be reliably observed now → **Ability**.
- Specifies “how much / how many / how broad,” scale/reach, or bandwidth **while preserving coherence** → **Capacity** (or “bandwidth/headroom/coverage”).
