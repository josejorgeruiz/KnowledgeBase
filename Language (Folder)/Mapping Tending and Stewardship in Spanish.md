## Excerpt

This concept paper fixes **Custodia** as the canonical Spanish lemma for *Stewardship* and **Cuidado** as the best lemma for *Tending*. It shows how **Cuidado** and **Custodia** function as “two kinds of care” across different planes—local practice and enterprise guardianship—and how they integrate with the **Trípode del Trabajo** (Tarea, Confianza, Cuidado), the **Tríada de Dirección** (Gestión, Liderazgo, Custodia), and the **Dominios de Competencia** (**Habilidad**, **Capacidad**, **Alcance**).

## Abstract

The canon distinguishes two care disciplines that must remain conceptually separate to keep organizations both humane and durable. *Tending* is the lived, local discipline that maintains people, interfaces, and learning in the flow of work. *Stewardship* is the enterprise guardianship that protects identity, ethics, and the license to operate across long horizons. With **Custodia** locked for stewardship, the Spanish lemma for tending must feel like everyday, local care and pair cleanly with **Custodia** as “dos formas de cuidado.” This paper establishes **Cuidado** for tending; reaffirms the Spanish mapping for the Domains of Competence—**Habilidad** (Ability), **Capacidad** (Capability, with *capacidad de contribución* as the technical phrase), and **Alcance** (Capacity as application span); and integrates these with the **Trípode del Trabajo** and the **Tríada de Dirección** (Gestión, Liderazgo, Custodia). Definitions, contrast lines, and canonical examples are provided to stabilize usage in role design, governance, and daily operations.

## Introduction

Translation in organizational design is architecture by other means. Terms carry distinctions that steer decisions, shape interfaces, and determine how intent travels at scale. The system requires two planes of care. At the node, teams need a discipline that keeps work humane and truly practiced—micro-repair, relational hygiene, and learning rhythms that actually occur. At the enterprise, leaders need a guardianship that preserves identity, ethics, and legitimacy across horizons—covenants, guardrails, and incentive structures that outlast any single tenure. With **Custodia** set for stewardship, the open design question is which Spanish lemma best names tending without blurring frames. The answer we advance is **Cuidado**.

## Fixing *Stewardship* as **Custodia**

Stewardship is enterprise guardianship. Its object is identity, ethics, and the license to operate; its scope is the enterprise and ecosystem, including boards and senior stewards; its horizon is measured in years and decades; its mode is macro-repair via covenants, guardrails, and incentive architecture. **Custodia** names this field in Spanish with precision: it signals responsible custody without implying ownership, and it naturally collocates with governance and institutional continuity. Within the **Tríada de Dirección**, **Custodia** stands alongside **Gestión** (reliability in the known) and **Liderazgo** (direction amid uncertainty) to ensure what performs today also endures tomorrow.

## Selecting *Tending* as **Cuidado**

### Framing with Custodia Fixed

Given **Custodia** for stewardship, the term for tending must denote concrete, day-to-day care; remain firmly inside the practice frame (not the legal or institutional frame); sit cleanly inside the **Trípode del Trabajo** beside Tarea and Confianza; and avoid collisions with DOES (especially Sustain/Sostener) and governance language.

### Rationale for **Cuidado**

**Cuidado** is idiomatic for lived, local care in organizational Spanish. Teams naturally “cuidan” relaciones, procesos, límites e interfaces; facilitators “cuidan” ritmos y aprendizaje; and leaders “cuidan” el espacio para conversaciones difíciles. The term covers micro-repair and human rhythm without drifting into legalism. Most importantly, **Cuidado** pairs elegantly with **Custodia** to express two planes of care: *El Cuidado es la disciplina local; la Custodia es la guardianía institucional*. This pairing is memorable, teachable, and operationally useful.

### Why Alternatives Fall Short

**Atención** centers noticing and responsiveness but weakly denotes repair and relational upkeep; as a pillar name it risks shrinking the discipline to mere issue response. **Acompañamiento** evokes a facilitation posture more than an operating discipline of a node; it reads closer to coaching style than to system practice. **Contención** is crisis-weighted and too narrow for everyday health. **Cultivo** is a strong metaphor for growth and development but over-indexes on development rather than repair and rhythm; it also risks confusion with capability-building constructs. **Sostener/Sostenimiento** collides directly with DOES (“Sustain”), blurring distinct system layers. In contrast, **Cuidado** is plain, local, and precise once framed in the canon.

## The Trípode del Trabajo in Spanish

The **Trípode del Trabajo** encodes the disciplines that make autonomy safe and productive inside a bounded node.

**Tarea** clarifies mandates and constraints so action is possible without guesswork. It defines what must be done, why it matters, and the guardrails within which discretion is granted. The act is **Encomendar**.

**Confianza** designs decision rights and verification so discretion is both granted and auditable. Trust is not a hope but a design choice realized through clear interfaces, escalation paths, and review rhythms. **The act is Confiar**.

**Cuidado** keeps people, interfaces, and learning healthy. It performs micro-repair, maintains human rhythm, and ensures the node’s routines—retros, reviews, renewals—actually occur. In short: **Cuidado** makes autonomy humane in real time. The act is **Cuidar**.

Read together and aloud—*Trípode del Trabajo: Encomendar, Confiar y Cuidar*—the triad is legible and easy to teach. Capitalization signals that **Cuidado** is a named discipline, not a sentiment. **Cuidar** implies care, not supervision. 

## The Tríada de Dirección in Spanish

The **Tríada de Dirección** composes and safeguards enterprise direction across nodes and time.

**Gestión** secures reliability in the known. It builds standards, cadences, and feedback loops so systems deliver consistently without micromanagement. Its horizon is months to a year; its virtue is dependable throughput within clear constraints.

**Liderazgo** composes direction amid uncertainty. It frames the problem space, selects consequential bets, communicates intent, and adapts as contexts shift. Its horizon traverses quarters to several years; its virtue is judgment under ambiguity.

**Custodia** preserves identity and coherence across horizons. It binds means to ends, installs guardrails, and designs incentives that prevent value drift. Its horizon is multi-year to generational; its virtue is continuity with integrity. Together, Gestión, Liderazgo y Custodia prevent stagnation, drift, and erosion of principle, respectively.

## The Domains of Competence in Spanish

A shared diagnostic grammar prevents teams from talking past each other. The canon’s triad cleanly separates present skill, structural judgment, and application span, and in Spanish maps as follows.

**Habilidad (Ability).** Present, demonstrable skill and know-how. It is visible in execution today and improves with practice, coaching, and feedback. Diagnostics center on quality, speed, accuracy, stability, and safety.

**Capacidad (Capability).** Structural power to handle complexity across time while maintaining coherence. It is the depth of judgment and sense-making a person can sustain as span and horizon extend. When precision is needed, use **capacidad de contribución** to name the level and time span at which a person or system can add value reliably.

**Alcance (Capacity).** The application span of ability and capability: how far, how wide, and through how many teams, layers, and regions intent and standards can travel without distortion. This deliberately reframes capacity away from mere throughput and toward **reach with integrity**, enabling phrases like *alcance operativo* or *alcance de la estrategia*.

The three domains interact multiplicatively. **Habilidad** bounds execution quality; **Capacidad** bounds altitude and time depth; **Alcance** bounds how far judgment and craft can travel intact. Lifting only one shifts the constraint elsewhere.

## How **Cuidado** and **Custodia** Interlock with **Habilidad, Capacidad, Alcance**

**Cuidado** is enacted through **Habilidad**—the micro-skills of difficult conversations, interface hygiene, facilitation, and learning design. It presupposes **Capacidad** to read context and time interventions; without it, care becomes misplaced effort. Healthy **Cuidado** expands **Alcance** because standards and intent transmit with less friction when interfaces are tended and rhythms are kept.

**Custodia** relies on **Capacidad** at institutional scale—meaning-making across long horizons and the translation of purpose into guardrails, commons, and succession. Its contribution to **Alcance** is indirect but decisive: when guardrails are explicit and culture codifies non-negotiables, thousands of peripheral decisions align without central adjudication. **Custodia** also requires specific **Habilidades**—crafting mandates and red lines, diagnosing irreversibility, architecting incentives that reward honorable means, not only ends.

The feedback loop is simple and powerful: **Cuidado** surfaces ground truth; **Custodia** reforms the system in response. Two planes, one logic of care.

## Canon-Faithful Sentences and Examples (Spanish)

**Contrast of planes.**  
El **Cuidado** es la disciplina local y vivida; la **Custodia** es la guardianía institucional de largo horizonte.

**Micro vs. macro repair.**  
El **Cuidado** hace la microreparación; la **Custodia** hace la macroreparación.

**Transmission of intent.**  
Sin **Cuidado** de interfaces, el **alcance** de la estrategia se degrada; con **Custodia** clara, la intención viaja intacta a los bordes.

**Role calibration.**  
Su **habilidad** operativa es sólida; su **capacidad de contribución** permite sostener decisiones a 24 meses; su **alcance** actual cubre dos plantas sin pérdida de estándares.

**Triad interplay.**  
La **Gestión** instala el ciclo común; el **Liderazgo** compone tres apuestas; la **Custodia** define criterios de irreversibilidad y sucesión.

## Implementation Notes for Designers and Coaches

Anchor diagnoses in the domains. If execution falters, name **Habilidad** and specify the skills to build. If judgment collapses with longer horizons or wider span, name **Capacidad** and recalibrate contribution level, coaching, or structure. If intent dies at the edges, name **Alcance** and redesign interfaces, standards, and replication mechanisms.

Treat **Cuidado** as a named discipline in artifacts and diagrams. Capitalize it; bind it to its object set—personas, interfaces, aprendizaje—and locate it explicitly in the **Trípode del Trabajo**. Use ordinary Spanish verbs to keep it lived: *cuidar el límite*, *cuidar el ritmo del equipo*, *cuidar la relación con upstream y downstream*. Reserve **Custodia** for the long-arc work in the **Tríada de Dirección**; when emphasis is needed, *Custodia institucional* disambiguates the frame.

Prevent collisions by design. Avoid *Sostener* as a pillar label (it belongs to DOES). Keep **Capacidad** distinct from *potencial* to separate structural contribution from headroom for growth. Maintain **Alcance** as application span, not throughput, so scaling remains the art of making intent and standards travel intact.

## Conclusion

With **Custodia** fixed for *Stewardship*, selecting **Cuidado** for *Tending* yields a crisp, teachable grammar: **dos formas de cuidado** en dos planos distintos. **Cuidado** keeps the node humane and healthy in real time; **Custodia** preserves identity, ethics, and license to operate across horizons. These sit alongside **Gestión** and **Liderazgo** in the **Tríada de Dirección**, and atop the **Dominios de Competencia**—**Habilidad**, **Capacidad** (*capacidad de contribución*), and **Alcance**—which provide the diagnostic backbone for design and governance. Adopted together, this Spanish preserves conceptual boundaries, prevents system collisions, and enables responsible scaling: extend **Alcance** sin desbordar **Capacidad** ni agotar **Habilidad**, practicando **Cuidado** localmente y ejerciendo **Custodia** institucionalmente.
