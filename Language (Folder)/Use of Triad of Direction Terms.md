## Instruction

Apply the **Glossary** as the authoritative reference when deciding whether to **KEEP** or **CHANGE** usages of **Management**, **Leadership**, and **Stewardship** within the **Triad of Direction**. These three terms are **reserved** and must only be used with the meanings below.

---

## Decision rule

### 1) Detect target terms
Detect (case-insensitive) the reserved terms and their common surface forms:

- **Management**: “management”, “manage”, “manages”, “managed”, “managing”
- **Leadership**: “leadership”, “lead”, “leads”, “led”, “leading”, “leader(s)”
- **Stewardship**: “stewardship”, “steward”, “stewards”, “stewarded”, “stewarding”

> Note: If multiple terms appear, evaluate each usage independently.

### 2) Check meaning against the glossary
Use these meanings (no substitutions):

- **Management** = organizing work, coordinating resources, and ensuring execution within defined systems; planning, structure, control; reliable outcomes in known conditions.
- **Leadership** = creating direction, fostering alignment, and sustaining commitment amid complexity; expressed through judgment, influence, and sense-making.
- **Stewardship** = guiding, protecting, and advancing something of value beyond self and across time; sustaining continuity, coherence, ethics, and institutional legacy.

**Horizon fit sanity check (supporting, not overriding):**
- **Present** = performance & reliability (Management emphasis)
- **Future** = transformation & evolution (Leadership emphasis)
- **Enduring** = identity, continuity, legitimacy / license to operate (Stewardship emphasis)

### 3) Decide what to do
- **KEEP the term choice** when the usage aligns with the matched definition.
  - You **may** still rewrite for clarity/conciseness (e.g., replace abstract nouns with active verbs), as long as intent, scope, tense, and polarity are preserved.
- **CHANGE** when the term is used outside its definition:
  - Prefer an **active-verb rewrite** that states what is actually happening.
  - If the sentence clearly indicates one of the other two meanings, you may **swap to the correct term** instead of rewriting—only when the swap makes the sentence strictly definition-correct.

**Ambiguity rule:** if context is ambiguous but plausibly aligned with the definition, **do not change** (and do not swap). Optional clarity-only rewrites are allowed.

## Do-not-change exemplars (canonical)

Treat these as reference patterns for correct usage and expected rewrites.

- “She manages day-to-day operations to meet SLAs.” ✅ (Management)
- “He led the company through a market pivot amid uncertainty.” ✅ (Leadership)
- “They steward the organization’s mission and reputation across generations.” ✅ (Stewardship)

## Common misuses and how to fix

### Misuse: “Leadership” used for routine control/execution
- “Shows leadership in enforcing SOP checklists”  
  → “Manages SOP compliance and daily adherence.”  
  *(or)* → “Ensures SOP compliance and daily adherence.”

### Misuse: “Management” used for direction under uncertainty
- “Manages a multi-year strategy shift”  
  → “Leads a multi-year strategy shift amid market change.”  
  *(or)* → “Sets direction for a multi-year strategy shift amid market change.”

### Misuse: “Stewardship” used for short-term performance tasks
- “Owns dashboard stewardship”  
  → “Manages the performance dashboard.”  
  *(or, if the intent is truly long-horizon governance)* → “Stewards data ethics and long-term governance.”

### Misuse: “Leadership” used when the emphasis is legacy/ethics/identity
- “Leads our code-of-conduct program”  
  → “Stewards our ethics and conduct standards over time.”  
  *(If the sentence is primarily operational administration, prefer a Management rewrite instead.)*
