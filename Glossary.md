## Ability 
Ability is the practical skill and know-how to perform tasks effectively within a given role. Unlike capability, which reflects potential across time horizons, ability is grounded in applied knowledge, skills, and experience. It represents what can be reliably executed in the present and can be developed further through practice.
**Spanish: Habilidad**
## Architecture of Work
The Architecture of Work describes how organizations design and align borders of delegation, escalation, and autonomy to distribute complexity, control, and judgment. It clarifies who holds which decisions, under what authorization and approvals, so work remains safe, stretching, and coherent across levels, horizons, and evolving conditions, supporting capability-alignment, trust, renewal.
**Spanish: Arquitectura del Trabajo**
## Appreciation
Appreciation is a qualitative, interpretive judgment that understands and values how an individual makes sense of complexity over longer time spans. It estimates current and emerging levels of capability, anticipates transition points, and informs role fit and development, without scores or pass/fail, honoring dignity, context, evolving potential, and growth continuously.
**Spanish: Apreciación**
## Assessment
Assessment is a structured process for gathering information about an individual’s personality, behavior, thinking patterns, abilities, or skills. It is diagnostic rather than judgmental, aimed at understanding the current state and future ability and capacity. Assessment informs decisions, guides development, and supports alignment without assigning value, making comparisons, or determining outcomes.
**Spanish: Valorización**
## Autonomy Paradox
The Autonomy Paradox describes the tension between the human desire for freedom and the simultaneous need for structure and certainty. Too much control stifles creativity, while unlimited freedom creates disorientation. Effective leadership balances autonomy with clarity, enabling individuals and organizations to thrive in environments that demand both safety and stretch.
## Border of Delegation
The Border of Delegation defines the outer limit of what a role holder may appropriately pass downward while remaining accountable. It marks where lending authority supports growth and execution, and where further delegation would misalign capability, risk, or mandate, requiring the work or decision to be retained or escalated upward.
## Border of Escalation
The Border of Escalation defines the point at which a role holder must hand complexity upward because authority, risk, or time horizon exceed their remit. It marks when owning the issue becomes unsafe or ineffective, requiring higher-level judgment, authorization, or approval to hold, reframe, or decide the work in practice.
## Capability
Capability is the power to navigate complexity through judgment, sense-making, and meaning-making across individual, organizational, and institutional layers. Stacked alignment shapes how self, systems, and institutions interpret, frame, anticipate, decide, and adapt—sustaining coherence, direction, and resilience over time.  ￼  ￼  ￼
### Individual Capability
Individual capability is the depth of judgment and meaning-making that turns ambiguity into direction across near-to-long horizons; it frames situations, discerns what matters, builds mental models, weighs trade-offs, anticipates, decides, and adapts to contribute effectively in volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous contexts.
### Organizational Capability
Organizational capability is system-level coherence—the way decision rights, structures, and culture convert diverse perspectives into shared sense and coordinated action over time; it aligns people and strategy to sustain performance, anticipate and adapt under uncertainty, and deliver direction that outlasts individuals.
### Institutional Capability
Institutional capability is enduring guardianship of identity and legitimacy that embeds governance, standards, and narrative norms, clarifies decision rights, stewards succession, and authorizes principled renewal; it holds the Enduring Horizon and sets guardrails for the Future Horizon so reliability and coherence persist across generations. 
## Contribution Bands
Contribution Bands are a six-band scale indicating the scope at which a person reliably contributes—aligned to organizational complexity, accountability, and time span. Contribution Bands calibrate role fit, stretch, and risk without hierarchical labels. Reports show current placement, natural span, and recommended stretch to match people, work, and decisions across near-to-enduring horizons.
### Band One — Execution
Reliable completion of defined tasks within established routines, following standard work to meet quality, safety, and timing—maintaining steady flow and accurate handoffs across short horizons (≈0–3 months).
### Band Two — Mastery
Applies experience to refine local methods, coach peers, solve short-cycle problems, and standardize practice—elevating throughput and reliability across functions and shifts within safe, mid-range horizons (≈3–12 months).
### Band Three — Scaling
Orchestrates cross-team optimization, designs and runs pilots, and converts proven methods into standardized, scalable practices—boosting end-to-end flow, quality, and cost efficiency across value streams over medium horizons (≈6–24 months).
### Band Four — Architecture
Translates strategy into target-state designs and shared platforms; defines interfaces, standards, and governance; sequences cross-functional programs and aligns resources and risks to scale durable systems over multi-year horizons (≈1–3 years).
### Band Five — Compass
Orients enterprise direction under uncertainty; chooses arenas and advantage logic (where-to-play/how-to-win); allocates portfolios and capital; sets guardrails and risk posture; and shapes operating-model constraints to compound advantage across businesses over extended horizons (≈2–5 years).
### Band Six — Continuum
Sustains and renews institutional identity and license; aligns policy, culture, and ecosystem commitments; sponsors resilience platforms, succession, and cross-generational bets; and safeguards reputation and ethics to maintain coherence through cycles and shocks over long horizons (≈5–10+ years).
## Capacity
Capacity is the scope, reach, and scale at which ability and capability can be applied while preserving coherence. It defines how far and how widely intent, standards, and judgment travel through people, structures, and time, especially as the organization grows, scales, and evolves.
### Individual Capacity
Individual capacity is the scale of how broadly a person applies ability and capability across teams, systems, and timeframes. It reflects influence, coordination, and operating across domains. Shaped by personal maturity and systemic support, it is relational—high capacity cannot be sustained without the scaffolding and structure of organizational capacity. 
### Organizational Capacity
Organizational capacity is the collective reach, scope, and scale at which an institution’s ability and capability can be applied while preserving coherence, quality, and alignment. It defines how far and how widely strategy, standards, and decisions can travel through structures, teams, and regions—distinct from capability, which reflects strength in navigating complexity.
## Complexity Quotient (CQ) 
Complexity Quotient (CQ) is an organization’s shared capacity to perceive evolving patterns, stay oriented amid ambiguity, and act with provisional clarity while learning. CQ coordinates sensing, sense-making, and adaptive action across roles and routines, producing coherence without overcontrol. It rises through diverse perspectives, feedback loops, simple rules, and disciplined experimentation.
## DOES Leadership Model
The DOES Leadership Model — Design, Organize, Execute, Sustain — is a cyclical framework that connects vision to structure, structure to action, and action to renewal. It empowers organizations and individuals at every level to navigate complexity, align capability with strategy, lead transformation, and create enduring impact through purposeful, adaptive practice.

## Domains of Competence
Domains of Competence describe the integrated system of ability, capability, and capacity that determines performance. Ability is a demonstrable skill; capability is judgment for handling complexity across time; capacity is the scalable breadth and volume of work. Aligning all three prevents category errors, guides role fit, and enables coherent, sustainable execution.  ￼
## Dynamic Portability of Contribution
Dynamic portability of contribution is the degree to which a person’s real impact travels and scales across roles, stages, and contexts over time. It depends on the evolving balance between individual and organizational capability, the core challenge of the work, and how well roles are designed for current complexity demands.
## Experience
Experience is the lived process of applying knowledge and skills in real-world situations, where success, failure, and reflection lead to deeper learning. It is developed through exposure, repetition, and challenge, but its value lies in how it shapes judgment. In organizations, experience becomes communal when after-action reviews, coaching, and rotations transform individual lessons into shared insight. 
## Evaluation
Evaluation is the process of applying judgment to determine how well something meets defined criteria or expectations. It interprets data gathered through assessment, compares performance against benchmarks, and informs decisions. Evaluation is not neutral—it carries consequences, supports accountability, and ensures alignment between individual contribution and organizational standards or goals.
**Spanish: Evaluación**
## Flow
Flow is a psychological state where challenge and capability are balanced, enabling deep focus, intrinsic motivation, and optimal performance. In this state, individuals lose track of time, feel fully absorbed, and experience clarity of action. Flow fosters learning, creativity, and sustained energy, turning effort into meaningful achievement.
## Competence
Competence is the demonstrated integration of knowledge, skills, and judgment applied effectively in specific contexts. It reflects not just what someone knows, but how reliably they perform under real conditions. Built through practice and experience, competence translates potential into consistent execution, making it a practical benchmark of readiness and effectiveness.
## Competency
Competency is the integration of knowledge, skills, and behaviors that enable effective performance in a specific context or level of work. It represents the observable expression of underlying capability, aligning cognitive capacity, emotional intelligence, and technical proficiency with the complexity and purpose of the role ￼.
### Culture Coherence Prism
The Culture Coherence Prism is a belief-based model that measures organizational culture across ten bipolar dimensions, producing individual profiles and group distributions. It reveals coherence, diversity, and designed tension, enabling leaders to align strategy, decision rights, and routines for selection, teaming, integration, transformation, and ethical, context-appropriate performance over time, sustainably.
## Current Level of Capability
Current Level of Capability refers to the complexity of work an individual can handle effectively at present. It reflects their capacity to process information, make judgments, and deliver consistent, valued results under existing conditions, without assuming potential future growth or development .
## Judgment
Judgement, in the BIOSS framework, is the process of weighing factors, knowledge, experience, and non-verbalized insight to reach a decision. It represents the human capacity to act amid uncertainty, where knowledge and experience may be insufficient. Good judgement balances intuition and analysis, transforming ambiguity into coherent, purposeful action
## Knowledge
Knowledge is the accumulation of information, facts, and understanding gained through learning, study, or experience. It forms the raw material from which ability develops, providing the foundation for skills and competencies. Unlike capability, which interprets complexity, knowledge represents what is already known, codified, and transferable across people and contexts.
## Leadership
Leadership is the practice of creating direction, fostering alignment, and sustaining commitment in the face of complexity. It is not confined to position or authority but expressed through judgment, influence, and sense-making. Leadership balances present demands with future possibilities, enabling people and organizations to adapt, cohere, and thrive.
## Levels of Work
Levels of Work describe the hierarchy of complexity within organizations, defining the scale, scope, and time span of decision-making at each level. Each level represents a distinct pattern of judgment and responsibility, aligning cognitive capability with role demands to ensure effective alignment between people, work, and organizational purpose ￼
### Level of Work 1: Quality
Quality focuses on producing consistent, accurate, and tangible results within clearly defined parameters. The work is concrete, immediate, and procedural, emphasizing precision, reliability, and adherence to standards. Success depends on attention to detail, task discipline, and ensuring outputs meet established measures of quality and compliance. The time span—1 day to 3 months—emphasizes short-cycle tasks and measurable quality outcomes.
### Level of Work 2: Service
Service focuses on first-line management and specialist roles that customize responses to specific situations within policies and systems. Accountability includes assigning work, interpreting policy, coaching, and balancing individual cases with purpose. Time-span is three to twelve months; capability centers on accumulating information to choose either-or options.
### Level of Work 3: Practice

Work at this level safeguards long-term coherence, guiding purpose across generations. The time span—20 to 50 years—focuses on foresight, institutional legacy, and shaping conditions for future relevance and renewal.
## Management
Management is the discipline of organizing work, coordinating resources, and ensuring execution within defined systems and processes. It emphasizes planning, structure, and control to deliver reliable outcomes in known conditions. Unlike leadership, which orients toward complexity and change, management provides stability, efficiency, and consistency in day-to-day operations.
## Management Horizon
Management Horizon is the framework that defines how leaders engage with time, complexity, and purpose. It encompasses three interwoven horizons—Present, Future, and Enduring—each reflecting distinct forms of work: managing performance, leading transformation, and stewarding continuity. It aligns capability, judgment, and responsibility across expanding spans of time
### Present Horizon
Present Horizon is where management, leadership, and stewardship converge to ensure present performance and system reliability. It encompasses Level of Work 1 (Quality), Level of Work 2 (Service), and Level of Work 3 (Practice as Continuous Improvement). Its time span—0 to 2 years—focuses on execution, consistency, and adaptive refinement within the current system.
### Future Horizon

It includes Level of Work 5 (Strategic Intent as Viability), Level of Work 6 (Corporate Citizenship), and Level of Work 7 (Corporate Prescience), focusing on legacy, resilience, and long-term coherence across generations.
## Four Quadrants of Decision Making
Decision-making mapped by two axes—what is known and what is controlled—yields four quadrants: known-controlled (standard execution), known-uncontrolled (influence and positioning), unknown-controllable (structured learning and innovation), and unknown-uncontrolled (resilience and sensing). Leaders iterate across quadrants, converting uncertainty into coordinated action and aligning choices with near-, mid-, and long-horizon stewardship and governance.
## Meaning-Making 
Meaning-Making is the second stage in the Progression of Meaningful Response, asking “What does this mean?” It connects events to purpose, values, and identity, transforming disorientation into direction. By contextualizing change within broader narratives, meaning-making enables leaders and organizations to align emotion with significance, turning uncertainty into focused energy.
## Nature of Work
Nature of Work describes the qualitative pattern of value creation at a given level: its central theme, objectives, responsibilities, creativities, and vulnerabilities. It characterizes what the work is about in practice, across domains, distinguishing Quality, Service, Practice, Strategic Development, and other themes, independent of time-span or structural level and context.
## Mode of Thinking
Mode of Thinking is the underlying cognitive structure that determines how an individual processes complexity, handles uncertainty, and manages time horizons. It reflects potential capability—the highest level of work complexity one can eventually manage—progressing from concrete, fact-based reasoning to abstract, systemic integration of interdependent variables ￼.
## Sense-Making
Sense-making is the process of interpreting volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) to create shared meaning and direction. It requires discerning patterns in chaos, clarifying shifting conditions, and framing challenges without precedent. In organizations, sense-making aligns perspectives and enables coherent action when environments are unstable, unpredictable, intricate, and unclear.
## Skills
Skills are learned proficiencies that enable effective execution of tasks in known or knowable conditions. Developed through practice, repetition, and exposure, they translate knowledge into action and form the building blocks of ability. Skills range from technical expertise to interpersonal effectiveness and support consistent, reliable performance within established contexts.
## SIPOC
SIPOC is a simple, high-level process framing tool that maps Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, and Customers. It clarifies who provides what, how work transforms value, and for whom results matter, aligning expectations, boundaries, and measures across functions. SIPOC diagrams stabilize interfaces, expose assumptions, and support coherent design of roles upfront.
## Space of Autonomy
The Space of Autonomy is the field of decisions, actions, and judgments a holder owns between borders of delegation and escalation. Refined by the tripod of work and SIPOC, it clarifies what value is created, for whom, and how, keeping challenge and capability balanced while judgment and flow grow effectively.
## Stewardship
The disciplined practice of guiding, protecting, and advancing something of value beyond personal interest and across time. It sustains continuity, coherence, and ethical purpose by ensuring that organizational systems, culture, and legacy endure, evolve, and serve others well beyond the leader’s direct influence or tenure.
## Organization
An organization is a living system that evolves from founder-driven momentum to institutional stewardship. It balances individual capability with structures and processes, aligning talent, leadership, and strategy to meet rising complexity. At its best, it becomes an adaptive ecosystem that sustains purpose, fosters trust, and delivers lasting contributions.
## Organizational Stages
The Organizational Stages describe the developmental journey of an enterprise from inception to adaptive maturity. Each stage reflects increasing structural complexity, strategic coherence, and systemic capability. Progression depends on aligning leadership, systems, and culture with growing organizational demands—transforming vision into structure, structure into strategy, and strategy into sustainable renewal.
### Stage Zero: Visionary Genesis
Creation begins with belief and drive. The founder’s vision shapes the organization before systems, roles, or structure exist.
### Stage One: Early Framework
Basic structures emerge. Founders build early processes and roles, transforming personal effort into an initial, resilient organizational form.
### Stage Two: Growth Acceleration
Expansion outpaces structure. Rapid scaling introduces complexity, requiring stronger coordination and prioritization to sustain growth and opportunity.
### Stage Three: Operational Maturity
Systems stabilize execution. Management layers, clear accountability, and empowered teams replace heroics with reliable, repeatable performance.
### Stage Four: Strategic Coherence
Governance and leadership align vision, systems, and accountability. Strategy integrates foresight, ethics, and risk into coherent organizational direction.
### Stage Five: Adaptive Renewal
Learning and agility define success. The organization evolves continuously, balancing stability with innovation to sustain long-term relevance and performance.

## Personality
Personality is the organized pattern of enduring traits, emotions, and behaviors that shape how an individual perceives, decides, and interacts with the world. It reflects consistent tendencies in response to complexity, uncertainty, and relationships, influencing motivation, leadership style, and alignment between self, role, and context ￼.
## Preferred Approach to Work under Uncertainty
Preferred Approach to Work under Uncertainty is an individual’s default way of gathering and using information when there is no clear answer. It reflects five style patterns from concrete-pragmatic to conceptual-intuitive and is positioned on two axes: Concrete–Conceptual and Analytical–Intuitive, inferred qualitatively from repeated uncertainty episodes during real, consequential work situations.
These are the styles:
#### A – Pragmatic Intuitive  
Pragmatic Intuitive is a concrete, hands-on style that gathers only essential information, relies on felt sense and immediate cues, acts quickly, and continually adjusts action in real time under uncertainty.
Concrete / task; Intuitive. 
Typical emphasis: doing, sensing, adjusting rapidly.  
#### B – Pragmatic Analysis  
Pragmatic Analysis is a concrete, task-focused style that gathers detailed factual information, analyses problems stepwise, tests options pragmatically, and refines solutions through methodical troubleshooting when facing uncertain or changing conditions.
Concrete / task; Analytical. 
Typical emphasis: detailed troubleshooting, stepwise checking.  
#### C – Analytic Intuition  
Analytic Intuition blends data and gut sense, moving between detailed evidence and emerging patterns, holding multiple options in mind, then converging on a coherent way forward under uncertain, evolving conditions.
Mid / integrative on both axes. 
Typical emphasis: moving between data and patterns. 
#### D – Conceptual Analysis  
Conceptual Analysis prefers well-defined problems, exhaustive information, and structured reasoning, building clear models and comparisons before acting, seeking logical consistency and reliability when carefully dealing with complex or uncertain situations.
Conceptual; Analytical. 
Typical emphasis: defined problems, exhaustive evidence.  
#### E – Intuitive Analysis  
Intuitive Analysis is a conceptual, ambiguity-seeking style that starts from images or possibilities, rapidly spots patterns and reframes problems, then tests emerging ideas enough to move forward under uncertain conditions.
Conceptual; Intuitive. 
Typical emphasis: new models, possibilities, ambiguity-seeking.  
## Progression of Meaningful Response
*Progression of Meaningful Response* is the structured flow of cognitive disciplines—Sense-Making, Meaning-Making, Framing, and Solving—that guide how individuals and organizations navigate challenges. It moves from perceiving and interpreting reality, to defining what matters, to taking purposeful action, ensuring responses remain coherent, adaptive, and aligned in complex, uncertain conditions.
### Sense-Making
Sense-Making is the first stage in the *Progression of Meaningful Response*, asking “What is happening?” It is the act of orienting in volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity by scanning environments, discerning patterns, and stabilizing perception. Sense-making builds shared understanding, enabling individuals and organizations to interpret turbulent or unclear conditions.
### Meaning-Making
Meaning-Making is the second stage in the Progression of Meaningful Response, asking “What does this mean?” It connects events to purpose, values, and identity, transforming disorientation into direction. By contextualizing change within broader narratives, meaning-making enables leaders and organizations to align emotion with significance, turning uncertainty into focused energy.
### Framing
Framing is the third stage in the Progression of Meaningful Response, asking “What do we need to solve?” It defines the challenge by choosing the lens through which a problem is viewed. Framing turns uncertainty into strategic focus, ensuring collective effort addresses the right issue and unlocks productive action.
### Solving
Solving is the fourth stage in the Progression of Meaningful Response, asking “How do we solve this?” It applies logic, expertise, and structured methods to design and implement solutions. Dependent on prior sense-making, meaning-making, and framing, solving transforms clarity into tangible results, delivering coherent action in complex conditions.

## Triad of Direction 
The integrated practice of management, leadership, and stewardship at every level. Management delivers performance in known systems; leadership sets direction amid change; stewardship safeguards identity and long-term health. Calibrated across Present, Future, and Enduring horizons, it balances deliver, direct, and defend to align strategy, culture, and results.
