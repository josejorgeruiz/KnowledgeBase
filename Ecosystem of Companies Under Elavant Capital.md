## Alder Koten

### Building leadership teams by aligning capability with complexity.

[Alder Koten](https://alderkoten.com/) builds leadership teams that align individual capability with organizational complexity. Each engagement begins with a deep understanding of strategy, organizational stage, and cultural context to ensure that the right leader enters the right system at the right moment in its evolution.

The search process is anchored in the Anker Bioss Framework, integrating Hogan Assessments, BIOSS Career Path Appreciation (CPA), and Luks Prisma Leadership to evaluate leaders across personality, potential, and systemic fit.

Executive search functions as a discipline of alignment—creating coherence between people and systems, where capability meets challenge, performance becomes sustainable, and leadership becomes legacy.
