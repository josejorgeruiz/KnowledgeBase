## Value proposition

Founders and their teams use this service to redesign the company’s operating system for the Stage One (Early Framework) → Stage Two (Growth Acceleration) transition. The core move is to structure the organization as a network of Autonomy Nodes—bounded spaces of work defined by SIPOC, regulated by the Tripod of Work (tasking, trusting, tending), calibrated by Levels of Work, and oriented by the Management Horizon and Contribution Bands.

Strategy turns into distributed accountability with coherence: fast decisions close to the work, clear contracts with the rest of the value chain, and explicit roles in management, leadership, and stewardship.

Training sessions explain the frameworks; workshops apply them to your real business. The process itself is five linked steps.

⸻

## 1. Name the stage and sharpen the growth problem

Founders first locate the company clearly in Stage One (Early Framework) and define what Stage Two (Growth Acceleration) actually requires in terms of coordination, specialization, and time span of decisions.

- Map, through a diagnostic workshop, where growth is already outpacing structure: recurring bottlenecks at the founder, cross-functional work handled informally, and failure-prone handoffs.
- Articulate the 18–36 month strategic challenge: which markets, products, or scale inflection are driving the need to move into Stage Two.

Training focuses on Organizational Stages and the nature of work (complexity and time span). Workshops produce a Stage One → Stage Two diagnostic map and 3–5 priority “pressure points” in the value chain that must be redesigned as autonomy nodes.

## 2. Build a shared structural language: Horizons, Levels, Bands

The team then learns to “see” work through Management Horizon, Levels of Work, and Contribution Band, so structure is designed around decisions, complexity and timespan of discretion, not titles.

- **Management Horizon** distinguishes Present, Future, and Enduring horizons—operational performance, strategic change, and continuity/legacy—each with its own time span and judgment complexity.  
- **Levels of Work** describe the complexity of roles (e.g., from routine Quality work to cross-functional Strategic Development), giving a scale for matching tasks and decisions to capability.  
- **Contribution Bands** define the scope at which each person reliably contributes in flow (local execution, cross-team scaling, system architecture, etc.), preventing both underuse and over-stretch of key people.

Training sessions introduce these models and how they interlock. Workshops map current roles and people onto Horizons, Levels, and Bands, exposing:

- Where Stage Two work (longer time span, cross-functional complexity) is being absorbed informally.
- Where individuals are being asked to perform at a higher Level or Band than their current capability and support allow.

The result is a capability and contribution map that becomes the design constraint for the next step.

## 3. Design Autonomy Nodes as the core units of structure

Autonomy Nodes become the primary building blocks of the Stage Two organization.

Each node is designed as:

1. **Externally defined by SIPOC**
   - Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers are surfaced explicitly so upstream and downstream commitments are visible and negotiable. This makes the “external contract” of the node legible to the rest of the system.

2. **Internally regulated by the Tripod of Work**
   - **Tasking**: clear mandates, standards, and priorities.  
   - **Trusting**: delegated judgment with explicit guardrails and escalation criteria.  
   - **Tending**: care for people, interfaces, and learning in the node.  

   The Tripod governs how autonomy is exercised moment to moment inside the node: how work is assigned, how freedom is granted, and how the team looks after its own resilience and interfaces.

3. **Horizon- and Level-matched**
   - Each node is tied to a specific Level of Work and dominant Management Horizon (for example, Present / Level 3 Practice as Continuous Improvement, or Future / Level 4 Strategic Development).  
   - Required Contribution Bands are specified (e.g., CB2 for local mastery, CB3 for cross-team scaling), so the node’s autonomy is held at the right scope.

4. **Decision rights framed by the Four Quadrants of Decision Making**
   - Known vs. unknown and controlled vs. uncontrolled conditions create four decision quadrants; routine decisions in “known and controlled” sit deeper in the node, while high-uncertainty and low-control decisions are escalated by design.  

Workshops identify critical chunks of the value chain (e.g., “Demand Generation,” “Customer Onboarding,” “Core Product Delivery,” “People & Culture Foundations”) and formalize each as an Autonomy Node with SIPOC, Tripod intentions, Levels, Bands, Horizons, and decision quadrants.

Training clarifies the distinction between Tripod of Work (practice within the node) and Triad of Direction (institutional contribution across nodes and time), so the team doesn’t conflate operational autonomy with overall leadership.

## 4. Clarify management, leadership, and stewardship across nodes

The design then layers the Triad of Direction—management, leadership, stewardship—on top of the autonomy-node architecture.

- **Management** ensures performance and reliability within and across nodes: metrics, processes, capacity, and resource allocation.  
- **Leadership** steers change: evolving nodes, creating new ones, and orchestrating transitions as Stage Two complexity increases.  
- **Stewardship** protects and advances what must endure: purpose, values, reputation, key long-term commitments that cut across the node network.

Workshops assign Triad responsibilities:

- For each Autonomy Node, define who is accountable for its management, who leads its development or evolution, and who stewards its ethical and cultural boundaries over time.
- For the founder, reframe the role away from “owning many nodes” toward stewarding the node network and leading Stage Two/Stage Three transitions.

Training supports leaders in understanding Triad vs Tripod:

- **Tripod** = how autonomy feels and operates inside a node (tasking, trusting, tending).  
- **Triad** = what contribution must endure across nodes and horizons (management, leadership, stewardship).

The outcome is a direction map that makes explicit who manages, who leads, and who stewards each critical space of work.

## 5. Activate and sustain through the DOES cycle

The final step turns the architecture into a living operating system using the DOES cycle—Design, Organize, Execute, Sustain.

- **Design**  
  - Refine SIPOC contracts, node-level metrics, and decision quadrants.  
  - Align node boundaries with the Stage Two strategy so value-creating flows are clear.  

- **Organize**  
  - Assign people to nodes based on Horizons, Levels, and Contribution Bands.  
  - Set up minimal forums and cadences for cross-node coordination (for example, regular sessions focused on interfaces and shared risks).  

- **Execute**  
  - Run the work through nodes, using the Tripod balance (tasking, trusting, tending) to keep autonomy productive rather than chaotic.  
  - Use the Four Quadrants of Decision Making to decide what stays local, what is escalated, and what demands re-design of boundaries or standards.  

- **Sustain**  
  - Periodically review nodes, Levels, Bands, and Triad roles as the company moves deeper into Stage Two.  
  - Adjust SIPOC contracts, Horizons, and Tripod balances when new products, markets, or risks emerge.

Training provides leaders and managers with the mental models and checklists to run DOES cycles on their own. Workshops are where actual design, reallocation, and review decisions get made.

## What the founder and team end up with

- A Stage Two-ready architecture built from Autonomy Nodes whose SIPOC boundaries, Horizons, Levels of Work, and Contribution Bands™ are explicit.  
- A clear separation of practice and contribution: the Tripod of Work shapes daily autonomy inside nodes, while the Triad of Direction defines enduring institutional roles in management, leadership, and stewardship.  
- A decision system grounded in the Four Quadrants, preventing everything from flowing back to the founder when uncertainty rises.  
- A living DOES-based operating rhythm, so the structure evolves as growth unfolds instead of freezing into early bureaucratic scaffolding.

The process moves the organization from founder-centric improvisation to designed, distributed accountability—without losing speed, soul, or the ability to adapt.
