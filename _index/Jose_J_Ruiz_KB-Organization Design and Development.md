## Designing Borders of Delegation and Escalation to Create Spaces of Autonomy  

## Excerpt  

The Architecture of Work describes how organizations distribute complexity and control through three key constructs: the **Border of Delegation**, the **Border of Escalation**, and the **Space of Autonomy** in between. These boundaries determine what each person owns, what they must pass on, and where they can exercise judgment. When thoughtfully designed, they create emotional safety, enable flow, and align individual growth with institutional performance. When neglected, they generate anxiety, overreach, and disengagement, regardless of the quality of strategy or talent.  

## Abstract  

This paper introduces **The Architecture of Work** as a conceptual framework for understanding how authority, complexity, and human experience intersect in organizations. It proposes three central constructs:  

- **Border of Delegation** – the outer edge of what a role holder is expected and allowed to delegate to others while remaining accountable.  
- **Border of Escalation** – the point at which complexity, risk, or time horizon exceeds the role holder’s remit and must be escalated upward.  
- **Space of Autonomy** – the field of decisions, actions, and judgments that sit between those borders and are owned directly by the role holder.  

Using an architectural metaphor, the paper positions **management** as the builder of hard structural boundaries (walls), **leadership** as the shaper of softer, directional boundaries (hedges and pathways), and **stewardship** as the designer of subtle, guiding cues (furniture, lighting, textures). Together, these disciplines define how complexity is held, how people experience control and safety, and how they grow over time.  

When the Architecture of Work is well-designed, individuals can achieve through effective management, grow through thoughtful leadership, and transform through conscious stewardship. The organization gains not only control but also judgment, learning, and enduring performance.

## Introduction – Two Sides of One Coin  

Every professional lives with a continuous, often unspoken question:

> “How much of this can I hold, and where does my responsibility end?”

On one side of the coin lies **complexity**—the uncertainty, interdependence, and time horizon inherent in the work. On the other side lies **control**—the authority, discretion, and protection granted by the organization. The way these two sides are balanced determines whether the person experiences their work as meaningful and stretching or chaotic and unsafe.  

This balance does not exist in the abstract. It is felt in the daily decisions about whether to act, to delegate, or to escalate. These decisions are emotionally charged. They touch fear of losing control, temptation to hoard power, and the tension between autonomy and safety.  

The central claim of this paper is that these experiences are the product of an often invisible **Architecture of Work**: a system of boundaries and spaces that defines how much complexity each role is expected to hold and how that complexity is shared across the organization. To make this architecture visible and designable, we introduce three constructs: the Border of Delegation, the Border of Escalation, and the Space of Autonomy.  

---

## The Architectural Metaphor of Work  

### Management as Structural Walls  

In physical architecture, walls define where one room ends and another begins. They create privacy, establish ownership of space, and provide structural integrity.  

In organizational life, **management** plays an analogous role. It sets hard boundaries such as reporting lines, decision rights, budget authority, and non-negotiable constraints. Policies, approval matrices, and role descriptions are examples of these structural “walls.”  

These walls are necessary. Without them, accountability blurs and execution becomes unreliable. However, if they are drawn too tightly or placed without regard to human capability, they confine initiative and compress the Space of Autonomy into something narrow and transactional.  

### Leadership as Hedges and Pathways  

Physical spaces are also shaped by hedges, pathways, and thresholds that guide movement without fully enclosing it.  

This is the domain of **leadership**. Leaders define softer, interpretive boundaries—what is most important now, which trade-offs matter, which risks are acceptable, and where experimentation is welcome. They do this through framing conversations, prioritization, and the way they respond to both success and failure.  

Leadership does not move walls. It clarifies how people navigate within them. It creates paths that encourage certain flows of attention and effort while discouraging others. These hedges can be reshaped over time, allowing the Architecture of Work to adapt to new conditions.  

### Stewardship as Furniture, Light, and Texture  

Finally, there are subtle design choices—furniture placement, lighting, and textures—that influence how a physical space feels and how people behave without explicit instructions.  

In organizations, **stewardship** occupies this layer. It concerns the long-term well-being of the institution and its people: ethics, values, rituals, and the narratives that define what “good” looks like. Stewardship shapes the tacit rules: how we treat each other, what we protect fiercely, and what we are willing to sacrifice for continuity and integrity.  

Stewardship does not constrain with rules; it orients with meaning. It ensures that the Architecture of Work supports not only performance but also dignity, belonging, and renewal.  

Together, management, leadership, and stewardship form a **Triad of Direction** that defines the Architecture of Work. Walls, hedges, and textures interact to create a lived environment in which Borders of Delegation and Escalation are either clear and supportive or ambiguous and threatening.  

---

## The Border of Delegation  

### Definition  

The **Border of Delegation** is the outer edge of what a person in a role is expected and authorized to **push downward** to others. Beyond this border, delegation is either inappropriate or unsafe because it would misalign accountability, capability, or risk tolerance.  

It answers a practical question:

> “How far can I lean on others while still being the one who is truly answerable for the outcome?”

Delegation is not simply the transfer of tasks. It is the deliberate distribution of complexity. At the Border of Delegation, a role holder must discern which aspects of a problem can be safely owned by others and which must remain in their own hands.  
### How the Border of Delegation Is Shaped  

- **Management** defines the formal aspects of this border through role design, authority limits, and process architecture.  
- **Leadership** tests and stretches the border in real time by choosing when to entrust higher-stakes decisions as development opportunities.  
- **Stewardship** ensures that delegation does not become abdication, guarding against pushing risk downward in ways that are unethical or corrosive to trust.  

A well-designed Border of Delegation protects both the organization and the individual. It prevents senior roles from hoarding decisions that others could handle, and it prevents less experienced staff from carrying complexity that exceeds their current ability to hold it.  

---

## The Border of Escalation  

### Definition  

The **Border of Escalation** marks the point at which a role holder must **hand complexity upward**. Beyond this border, the problem’s scale, risk, or time horizon outstrips their remit or their authority to decide.  

It answers a complementary question:

> “At what point am I no longer the right person to hold this?”

Escalation is not a confession of failure; it is an exercise of judgment. It reflects recognition that some decisions belong at a higher level of work where broader context, longer time horizons, or greater authority legitimately reside.  

### Interdependence with the Border of Delegation  

Crucially, one person’s Border of Escalation is another person’s Border of Delegation. The junction where these borders meet is where the organization decides **who holds which part of the complexity, for how long, and under what conditions**.  

When these borders are misaligned, several patterns emerge:  

- Problems are ping-ponged between levels with no clear owner.  
- Issues remain stuck with individuals who lack authority to resolve them.  
- Senior leaders are overwhelmed by escalations that could have been settled below.  

When well aligned, the Border of Escalation becomes a reliable signal. People know when they must escalate, how to do so, and what framing is expected (context, options, recommendations). This creates both safety and discipline.  

---

## The Space of Autonomy  

### Definition  

The **Space of Autonomy** is the field between the Border of Delegation and the Border of Escalation in which a role holder is expected to **own decisions, exercise judgment, and act without seeking permission or passing responsibility**.  

It represents the functional “room” that a person inhabits within the Architecture of Work. Its size and quality shape whether the person experiences their role as cramped, overwhelming, or optimally challenging.  

### Complexity, Capability, and Emotional Safety  

For the Space of Autonomy to be healthy, three conditions must be met:  

1. **Complexity must match capability.**  
   The problems within the space should be sufficiently complex to engage the person’s full capability but not so overwhelming that they live in constant anxiety. Under-challenged individuals stagnate; over-challenged individuals burn out or retreat into defensive behavior.  

2. **Boundaries must be clear enough to feel safe.**  
   The person must know which decisions are theirs, which must be escalated, and which can be shared or delegated. Ambiguous borders turn every decision into a political calculation and erode trust in the system.  

3. **Support must be available without punishment.**  
   Within their Space of Autonomy, individuals should feel free to seek advice and test ideas without automatically triggering escalation or signaling incompetence. This enables learning and increases the quality of decisions over time.  

When these conditions are met, the Space of Autonomy often becomes a **space of flow**—where challenge and capability are in balance, attention is focused, and work feels meaningful.  

---

## Holding Space: The Dual Role of Leaders  

Every leader occupies both sides of the coin.  

- On one side, they live within a Space of Autonomy defined by somebody else’s Borders of Delegation and Escalation.  
- On the other side, they actively define those borders and that space for others.  

This dual role is where the Architecture of Work becomes most tangible. Leaders must navigate their own constraints while designing environments for their teams. Practically, this means they:  

- Use **management** to articulate clear expectations, decision rights, and constraints for their teams.  
- Use **leadership** to frame purpose, prioritize work, and calibrate stretch within the Space of Autonomy they grant.  
- Use **stewardship** to ensure that how they delegate and how they receive escalations reinforces trust, learning, and long-term wellbeing.  

When leaders consciously “hold space” in this way, they create environments where others can step into increasingly complex work without losing their sense of safety or purpose.  

---

## Designing the Architecture of Work  

### Aligning Borders with Levels of Work  

A coherent Architecture of Work aligns Borders of Delegation and Escalation with the underlying levels of work in the system. Roles at different levels are designed to hold different spans of time, risk, and complexity. Borders should reflect these differences consciously, not as accidents of personality or habit.  

This alignment ensures that:  

- Complexity resides at the level best equipped to hold it.  
- Stretch is intentional and supported, not random and punishing.  
- Escalation flows along clear channels, reducing both delay and blame.  

### Using Design as a Continuous Discipline  

The Architecture of Work is not a one-time blueprint; it is a living design discipline. Leaders can periodically ask:  

- Where are people chronically overloaded, and what does that reveal about the Border of Escalation?  
- Where are capable individuals underutilized, and what does that say about an overly narrow Border of Delegation?  
- Where is accountability unclear, and how might the Space of Autonomy be redrawn for clarity and fairness?  

Adjustments may involve reassigning decision rights, clarifying escalation paths, or rearticulating what “ownership” actually means at each level. Over time, this ongoing design work allows the organization to keep pace with changing strategy, scale, and context.  

---

## Conclusion – Boundaries That Enable Judgment  

The Architecture of Work is more than structure and process. It is the deliberate design of how complexity and control are shared across people and levels.  

- The **Border of Delegation** defines how far responsibility can be pushed downward without losing coherence or integrity.  
- The **Border of Escalation** defines when complexity must be lifted upward so that it can be held at the right level of work.  
- The **Space of Autonomy** between them is where people do their most meaningful work, exercise judgment, learn, and enter flow.  

When management, leadership, and stewardship are aligned, these boundaries do more than constrain behavior; they invite wise judgment. People are trusted to decide inside their space, supported to escalate beyond it, and encouraged to grow toward holding greater complexity over time.  

In such an architecture, individuals achieve through effective management, grow through thoughtful leadership, and transform through conscious stewardship. The organization, in turn, gains not only control and performance but also renewal and enduring capability. It becomes a place where the complexity of the world can be met with increasing depth, clarity, and shared responsibility.

# Autonomy Nodes: Bounded Autonomy, Trust-Based Authorization, and the Tripod of Work

## Excerpt
Autonomy Nodes are deliberate, bounded spaces of work that make promises explicit and confer **trust-based authorization** to use **judgment and discretion** while people are **tasked, trusted, and tended**. Horizontally, nodes connect through **SIPOC—Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers**—so one node’s customer becomes the next node’s supplier. Vertically, nodes connect at borders: the **border of escalation** for one node is the **border of delegation** for the node above. Held together by the **Tripod of Work**—tasking, trusting, and tending—these seams create flow, align responsibility with capability, and keep the system humane and effective.

---

## Abstract
This paper formalizes Autonomy Nodes as the smallest auditable unit of distributed accountability inside an organization and integrates Gillian Stamp’s **Tripod of Work** as the node’s internal discipline. Externally, a node is defined by **SIPOC (Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers)** so that upstream and downstream promises are legible and measurable. Internally, a node is governed by the Tripod of Work: **tasking** (defining outcomes and limits), **trusting** (delegating judgment and discretion), and **tending** (maintaining relevance, context, and support). These disciplines balance challenge and capability, reducing the “misuse” of people (overstretch beyond capability) and “disuse” (under-challenge that wastes capability). Vertically, the **border of delegation** specifies what can be passed downward while remaining accountable; the **border of escalation** specifies when matters must move upward because risk, scope, or implications exceed the mandate. When one node’s escalation border meets the next node’s delegation border, the seam of judgment is clean and fast. The result is principled speed and sustained flow: decisions happen where knowledge is freshest, learning returns where it can improve the next call, and the organization compounds performance and integrity.

---

## Introduction
Organizations often falter at the seams—where a handoff crosses a team boundary or where judgment must move between levels. Calls for “more autonomy” rarely help if autonomy is left for people to improvise. **Autonomy Nodes** address this by clarifying two interfaces at once. Along the value chain, **SIPOC (Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers)** states the promises that travel with work. Along the hierarchy, borders clarify the shift in judgment and risk between levels. Inside the node, **the Tripod of Work**—tasking, trusting, and tending—turns autonomy from a slogan into practiced responsibility. When these elements align, people exercise **judgment and discretion** with confidence, because they are explicitly **tasked, trusted, and tended**.

---

## Canonical Foundations: The Tripod of Work
**Origins and intent.** Developed by Gillian Stamp within the Bioss tradition, the Tripod of Work explains how responsibility is conferred, supported, and contained. It responds to two failure states that damage both people and organizations: **misuse** (challenges that significantly exceed current capability) and **disuse** (challenges that fall below it). The tripod’s purpose is to create the conditions for good work—psychological flow, sound judgment, and sustainable performance—by balancing three interdependent disciplines.

**Tasking—defining outcomes and limits.** Tasking is a disciplined conversation that clarifies outputs, quality parameters, cost constraints, and time frames. It anchors what “good” looks like and what must not be violated. Effective tasking sets **boundaries and expectations** without scripting method; it states completion time, degree of discretion, and conditions for review.

**Trusting—delegating judgment and discretion.** Trusting is not a vague feeling; it is **trust-based authorization**: a conscious design of **which decisions** may be taken independently, which require consultation, and which must be escalated. Trust is commensurate with capability and mandate, so people are neither constrained to mechanical execution (disuse) nor exposed to risk they cannot carry (misuse).

**Tending—maintaining relevance, context, and support.** Tending is the ongoing care of work, context, and the person doing it. It monitors without crowding, updates priorities as conditions shift, and keeps the narrative of purpose alive. Tending preserves ethics and relationships while ensuring that learning returns to the place where it will improve the next judgment.

**Optimal and distorted forms.** Held in balance, the tripod yields flow: clear ends (tasking), owned judgment (trusting), and living context (tending). Distortions are predictable. A **rigid tripod** hardens tasking into enforcing, collapses trusting into distrust, and mutates tending into policing. A **diffuse tripod** lets tasking degrade into handing-over, trusting dissolve into over-trust or abdication, and tending evaporate into neglect. Many stable, safety-critical settings use a **tripod of continuity**—tight tasking, experience-based trusting, administrative tending—which is appropriate until adaptation is required; then, the tripod must be consciously rebalanced.

---

## Defining the Autonomy Node
An **Autonomy Node** is a bounded unit of purpose, authority, and accountability that owns a coherent slice of value creation. It is characterized by:

1. **External Contract (SIPOC).** A SIPOC canvas that names Suppliers and the Inputs they commit to provide; makes the Process explicit; defines Outputs in terms of fitness-for-use; and identifies Customers who receive those outputs. This converts handoffs from hope into promise and makes measures discussable.

2. **Internal Discipline (Tripod of Work).**  
   - **Tasking:** a crisp mandate and permitted trade-offs.  
   - **Trusting:** **trust-based authorization** to use **judgment and discretion** within explicit decision rights and visibility.  
   - **Tending:** the care of people, interfaces, and learning routines, so autonomy strengthens rather than frays collaboration.

3. **Vertical Borders.** A decision charter that describes owned decisions, consultation points, and thresholds that cross the **border of escalation**; alignment so that the receiving level’s **border of delegation** meets that escalation border cleanly.

4. **Competence Fit.** Roles and mandates matched to the **Domains of Competence**—**ability** (demonstrable skill), **capability** (judgment for handling complexity across time), and **capacity** (the scalable breadth and volume of work).

---

## Horizontal Connection: Value Chain to Chain of Nodes
Following the value chain reveals a sequence of nodes linked by **SIPOC—Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers**. Because **one node’s customer becomes the next node’s supplier**, promises and measures travel with the work. When a mismatch appears, the first question is structural, not personal: Was the input ambiguous? Was fitness-for-use poorly specified? Did the process change without updating the promise? This framing turns disagreement into teachable improvement and reduces political friction at boundaries.

---

## Vertical Connection: Borders That Meet Cleanly
Judgment also moves vertically. The **border of delegation** states what a role holder is expected and authorized to pass downward while remaining accountable. The **border of escalation** names when an issue must be transferred upward because its risk, scope, or irreversibility exceed the mandate. The two borders interlock: **one node’s escalation border is the next node’s delegation border**. When the seam is explicit, issues rise with context, options, and a recommendation; decisions descend with authority, scope, and updated constraints. When the seam is vague, issues ping-pong, ownership blurs, and leaders drown in decisions that do not match their level of concern.

---

## The Space of Autonomy: Judgment and Discretion, Tasked-Trusted-Tended
The **Space of Autonomy** is the lived territory where people are **tasked, trusted, and tended** to use **judgment and discretion**. Four elements give this space practical force:

1. **Outcomes.** A small set of results and quality criteria expresses what “good” looks like.  
2. **Trade-off Rules.** Permitted exchange rates among cost, speed, scope, and risk make implicit judgments explicit.  
3. **Decision Thresholds.** Quantitative and qualitative limits clarify which decisions sit locally and which cross the escalation border—e.g., exposure beyond a set amount, regulatory implications, irreversible commitments, or cross-node dependencies.  
4. **Telemetry.** Leading and lagging signals make decisions observable in real time, coupling trust to visibility rather than supervision.

Adjusting thresholds and visibility expands or narrows the space without undermining confidence. Expansions are earned through demonstrated ability, growing capability, and sustained capacity; contractions are protective responses to volatility or signal drift and are framed as system changes, not personal blame.

---

## How the Tripod Powers the Node
- **Tasking stabilizes ends.** Clear outcomes and limits keep energy focused and reduce diffusion.  
- **Trusting stabilizes judgment.** Trust-based authorization turns decision rights into a routine, not an exception—people know what they can call and what they must elevate.  
- **Tending stabilizes relevance.** Boundary rituals—supplier–customer dialogues, cadence reviews, after-action reflections—keep interfaces healthy, ethics visible, and learning continuous.

Together, these disciplines counter **misuse** and **disuse**. Tasking matches challenge to mandate, trusting aligns discretion to capability, and tending keeps the match current as conditions shift.

---

## Suboptimal Patterns at Node Scale—and Their Remedies
- **Rigid Node (enforcing, distrust, policing).** Symptoms: slow decisions, initiative withers, reviews accumulate without action. *Remedy:* loosen tasking into clear ends with options, convert surveillance into telemetry, and specify trusted decisions explicitly.  
- **Diffuse Node (handing-over, over-trust/abdication, neglect).** Symptoms: guesswork, variable quality, conflict at boundaries. *Remedy:* sharpen outcomes and limits, re-authoritize concrete decision classes, reinstate tending rituals.  
- **Continuity-Bound Node (stability first).** Useful in safety-critical contexts but becomes brittle in change. *Remedy:* consciously broaden trusted decision classes and rehearse escalation frames before volatility arrives.

---

## Decision Flow Across Nodes
Healthy decision flow depends on the horizontal and vertical couplings working together. As outputs cross a SIPOC boundary, the receiving node exercises authorized **judgment and discretion** inside its Space of Autonomy. If a local decision would alter upstream feasibility or downstream commitments, the escalation border ensures the matter rises to the level where cross-node trade-offs belong; the matching delegation border ensures a timely, well-held decision, which is then re-delegated with updated constraints. In this way, a **ladder of judgment** mirrors the **chain of value**, preventing local optimization from injuring the whole.

---

## Calibrating Fit with the Domains of Competence
Delegation, escalation, and the scope of trusted decisions are calibrated to the **Domains of Competence**:
- **Ability** secures today’s execution quality.  
- **Capability** holds increasing complexity and longer consequences with sound judgment.  
- **Capacity** ensures the system can carry the breadth and volume of work without hidden queues.

When domains and mandate align, the right decisions are made at the right level. When they misalign, the system either hoards decisions above or pushes them below readiness. The corrective is to adjust staffing, coaching, and decision charters—not to add ad hoc approvals.

---

## Governance as Trust-Based Authorization
Governance sustains autonomy by keeping decisions observable and responsibilities explicit. Three anchors are sufficient and scalable:
1. **SIPOC promises** are verifiable at boundaries.  
2. **Decision charters** codify decision rights, thresholds, and escalation triggers—turning trust into structure.  
3. **Cadenced reviews** examine decision quality and escalation health (latency, framing completeness, rework trend) so borders and competencies are adjusted with evidence.

The governing posture is simple: people are **tasked, trusted, and tended** to use **judgment and discretion**; the system ensures their decisions are visible and their promises are kept.

---

## Implementation Path
1. **Map a value stream** and identify natural nodes.  
2. **Draft a SIPOC canvas** for each node: Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers; include measures and cadence.  
3. **Write the decision charter**: owned decisions, consult points, escalation thresholds, telemetry.  
4. **Rehearse the seam** where the lower node’s escalation border meets the upper node’s delegation border—agree framing, turnaround, and re-delegation patterns.  
5. **Embed Tripod rituals**: weekly tasking refresh, trusted-decision review, boundary tending with upstream/downstream partners.  
6. **Inspect and adapt** using decision latency, defect containment at boundaries, and the proportion of escalations resolved at the first receiving level.

---

## Conclusion
Autonomy Nodes translate strategy into distributed accountability by aligning three essentials. **SIPOC (Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers)** ties nodes into a chain of explicit promises. The **border of escalation** and **border of delegation** meet vertically to form a clean seam of judgment. Inside the boundary, Gillian Stamp’s **Tripod of Work—tasking, trusting, tending**—confers **trust-based authorization** to use **judgment and discretion** while keeping people, interfaces, and learning healthy. Calibrated by the **Domains of Competence** and disciplined by simple governance, this design yields principled speed: decisions happen where knowledge is freshest, learning returns to where it will improve the next call, and the organization compounds both performance and integrity.

## Eras of Power at Work

[Knowledge Base](https://josejruiz.com/knowledge-base/) > [Organizational Design and Development](https://josejruiz.com/organizational-design-and-development/)

## Excerpt
This paper advances a four-era hypothesis for how power organizes work. In each era, control over a decisive asset—protection, land, industrial capital, or knowledge-plus-reach—creates the choke point that shapes institutions, labor, and strategy. The framework helps leaders diagnose where power sits in their sector today, anticipate how it migrates, and align work design, governance, and investment to the true constraint rather than to legacy assumptions.

## Abstract
Power at work concentrates where a scarce, consequential asset confers leverage over risk, throughput, or coordination. The four-era hypothesis traces a sequence—protection, land, industrial capital, and knowledge-plus-reach—each pairing an “asset of record” with a characteristic institution and labor regime. In the protection era, authority accrues to actors who can reliably suppress violence and coordinate risk, legitimizing tribute for safety. In the agrarian era, control of arable land and water anchors hierarchy and revenue through tenure systems and hydraulic administration. In the industrial era, ownership and managerial coordination of plant, equipment, and logistics become decisive, separating ownership from control and scaling wage labor through corporate forms. In the information era, proprietary know-how, data, algorithms, and network reach centralize intermediation and attention, generating platform power and regulatory concern. The framework aids diagnosis of sectoral power by identifying the active choke point and aligning work design, governance, and strategy accordingly.

## Introduction
Executives often treat “power” as an abstract sociological idea or as a legal matter. Operationally, it is concrete: whoever controls the choke point that others must pass through decides how work is organized and how value is shared. Choke points shift with the asset that is scarcest and most consequential: in one epoch, it is muscle and arms; in another, water and acreage; later, machines and rail; now, code, data, and distribution.

This paper formalizes a four-era hypothesis of power at work and applies it as a diagnostic tool. Across eras we use a consistent lens—capability (how a system handles complexity), capacity (how much work the system can carry), and levels of work (the time span and complexity of decision rights)—to avoid category errors. We also connect the framework to the DOES leadership cycle (Design, Organize, Execute, Sustain) to translate diagnosis into operating choices.

## The Four Era Framework

### Protection
**Asset of record:** Coercive capacity and credible coordination of risk.  
**Coordinating institution:** Proto-states, chiefs, professional protectors.  
**Labor regime:** Tribute and service reciprocated by security.

Where violence is ambient and rules are thin, the decisive contribution is suppressing predation and stabilizing expectations. Power accrues to those who can reliably deliver peace and enforce bargains. Revenue resembles protection rents—tribute, tax, or fees for safe passage. Work structures are mobilized around defense, provisioning, and risk-sharing. Validation signals include the ability to deter rivals, to arbitrate disputes, and to lower the background cost of doing anything else.

**Design and governance implications.** Organizations embedded in this logic (e.g., private security, insurtech addressing catastrophic risk, critical infrastructure in fragile regions) must prioritize credibility, response time, and trust architecture. The DOES emphasis is **Design for risk**, **Organize for rapid mobilization**, **Execute with discipline**, and **Sustain** the legitimacy that makes compliance cheaper than defection.

### Land
**Asset of record:** Arable land and water control.  
**Coordinating institution:** Feudal tenure; hydraulic bureaucracy.  
**Labor regime:** Serfdom, tenancy, corvée; rents and harvest taxes.

When calories come from fields, the master keys become title, irrigation, and seasonal coordination. Authority tracks the soil and the sluice gate. Fiscal systems convert harvest into revenue; social order bundles status, military obligation, and law to protect the surplus. Work follows the calendar and the canal; innovation concentrates in surveying, storage, and grain logistics.

**Design and governance implications.** Modern echoes include spectrum licenses, mining concessions, port franchises, and rights-of-way—“land-like” assets whose control structures mirror agrarian power. In such sectors, leaders win by designing tenure clarity, compliance, and capital discipline around fixed assets. The DOES balance tilts to **Organize** (title, permits, maintenance regimes) and **Execute** (seasonal/throughput reliability), while **Sustain** focuses on soil-equivalents: asset integrity and social license to operate.

### Industrial Capital
**Asset of record:** Plant, equipment, and the administrative capacity to coordinate them.  
**Coordinating institution:** The managerial corporation.  
**Labor regime:** Scaled wage work; unions; scientific management.

Mechanization, telegraph/rail, and later containerization shift the choke point to capital goods and the visible hand that orchestrates them. The great innovation is not only machines, but management: multiunit coordination, standard costs, scheduling, and performance accounting. Profit pools form around scale, scope, and throughput. Ownership separates from control as professional managers exercise decision rights on behalf of dispersed capital.

**Design and governance implications.** Success depends on process design, cross-functional coordination, and cycle-time compression. The DOES profile peaks in **Execute** (operational excellence) and **Organize** (systems integration), with **Design** reframed as system architecture and **Sustain** as continuous improvement and reliability engineering. Levels of work migrate from short-cycle quality and service to strata that design and reconfigure entire value streams over years.

### Knowledge-plus-Reach
**Asset of record:** Proprietary know-how, algorithms, data, and distributional reach.  
**Coordinating institution:** Platforms, protocols, and standards ecosystems.  
**Labor regime:** Knowledge and creative work mediated by networks and APIs.

As value concentrates in information and intermediation, the scarcities are learning speed and audience access. Two-sided markets and network effects magnify small early advantages into durable reach. Defaults—search ranking, app store policy, interface design, recommender systems—become the new tollbooths. Attention, not inventory, gates throughput.

**Design and governance implications.** Strategy is as much about market-design as about product: pricing the sides, minimizing multihoming, cultivating complements, and policing integrity. The DOES rhythm elevates **Design** (mechanism design, trust & safety), **Organize** (developer ecosystems, governance), **Execute** (shipping changes at cadence), and **Sustain** (ethics, resilience, regulatory alignment). Talent systems must reward learning velocity and responsible autonomy; stewardship must address data rights and societal impact.

## Cross-Era Mechanics
Three continuities traverse the eras.

**First, a security bargain.** Legitimacy hinges on perceived safety: physical security; then food and flood security; later job and credit security; now cybersecurity, privacy, and information integrity. Each era enlarges what “safety” means and who is accountable for it.

**Second, technology-institution fit.** Assets pair with coordination technologies: land/water with territorial hierarchies; machines/rail with managerial hierarchies; code/networks with protocols and platform governance. Leaders who mis-fit structure to asset—e.g., bureaucratizing a platform or “flatting” a heavy plant—pay in friction and fragility.

**Third, scarcity migrates.** The bottleneck moves from material throughput to interaction throughput to attention. This migration relocates decision rights: industrialism empowered professional managers; platforms empower intermediaries who set defaults. In each shift, the meaning of “capacity” changes—from tonnage and floor space to API rate limits and model tokens.

## Diagnosing Power in a Sector
A practical diagnostic proceeds in four moves.

**1. Name the asset of record.** What single asset, if held by one actor, would let them set prices, terms, or rules? In airlines it may be slots and gates; in mobile, licensed spectrum and tower density; in semiconductors, leading-edge fabs and process IP; in payments, acceptance networks plus fraud models; in AI, compute, data pipelines, and distribution.

**2. Map the coordination surface.** Through what rules or interfaces must others pass? Tenure contracts, safety standards, interchange fees, app-store guidelines, ad auctions, security certifications. The “surface” is where leverage is exercised.

**3. Trace revenue logic to the choke point.** Rents, tolls, and switching costs reveal the active scarcity. If revenue scales with usage on both sides, you are playing platform economics; if it scales with turns on fixed assets, you are in industrial logic.

**4. Align work design to the constraint.** Determine which levels of work must dominate. Land-like assets require stewardship of concessions and long-cycle maintenance. Industrial assets require system designers and integrators. Platforms require mechanism designers, policy stewards, and developer/community managers. Staff roles should match the management horizon that the asset demands.

## Designing to the Choke Point
The DOES cycle provides a translation layer from diagnosis to action.

**Design.** Frame the market and operating model around the live scarcity. For land-like assets, design tenure clarity, rate cases, and reliability obligations. For industrial assets, design the end-to-end system (layout, buffers, standards). For platforms, design incentives, identity, and integrity; the “product” is often rule-making.

**Organize.** Allocate decision rights to where information is richest and delay is costliest. Industrial work favors cross-functional value-stream ownership; platform work favors small teams with crisp API contracts and strong policy counterparts. In concession businesses, organize around regulatory interfaces and asset stewardship.

**Execute.** Build cadence and feedback loops suited to the asset. Heavy assets demand TPM, root-cause rigor, and safety culture. Platforms demand continuous delivery, A/B infrastructure, and abuse response. Concessions demand compliance discipline and outage playbooks.

**Sustain.** Embed renewal into the work. In plants, this is continuous improvement and asset health. In platforms, it is trust-and-safety evolution and responsible AI practices. In concessions, it is community legitimacy and environmental resilience. Stewardship is not a sentiment; it is a workload.

## Transitions and Seams
Power migrations create predictable friction.

**Land → Industry.** Enclosure, urbanization, and labor mobility rewrite obligations. Winners master logistics and wage discipline; losers cling to rents without productivity. Organizations must shift from tenure management to process engineering and build managerial layers that handle longer time spans of discretion.

**Industry → Platforms.** Standards wars, IP battles, and distribution capture define the frontier. Managers accustomed to throughput may underweight mechanism design and developer relations. Legacy P&Ls struggle to price complements and fund “loss-leaders” on one side of a market. Boards should update guardrails to address integrity risks and regulatory exposure that come with intermediation power.

**Analog → AI-mediated.** In AI-intensive sectors, the choke point blends compute access, proprietary data pipelines, model quality, and distribution. The temptation is to treat models as plant; the reality is closer to platform governance and continuous learning systems. Capability must shift toward model stewardship, evaluation science, and safety engineering.

## Hybrid and Edge Conditions
Few sectors are “pure.” Telecom combines land-like spectrum, industrial towers, and platform-like app layers. Energy mixes land (leases), industrial plant (generation, grid), and data/platform elements (demand response). Healthcare interweaves licensed privilege (land-like), heavy capital (industrial), and data/attention (platform). Leaders should resist single-era metaphors and instead ask: which choke point dominates **here and now**, and which is **emerging**?

A practical method is to maintain a “power stack” for your sector: rank the assets by leverage today; assign owners; note interfaces; and monitor precursors (new standards, regulatory drafts, cost curves) that signal the next migration. Update your operating model as the active constraint changes, not when the org chart is ready.

## Implications for Leaders and Boards
1) **Set the mandate to the era.** Board guardrails should name the choke point and the non-negotiables tied to it—system integrity for plants, ecosystem integrity for platforms, and legitimacy for concessions.

2) **Fund the bottleneck.** Allocate capital and senior time to the active constraint. Under-investing in mechanism design, integrity, or maintenance is not thrift; it is a slow transfer of power to rivals or regulators.

3) **Align capability with horizon.** Staff roles at the level of work the asset demands. A platform’s abuse policy cannot be run with short-horizon thinking; a refinery cannot be stewarded with purely project-based temporality.

4) **Measure what power measures.** In platforms, track multihoming rates, time-to-trust, and integrity incidents; in plants, OEE and time-to-recover; in concessions, uptime, penalties avoided, and community consent.

5) **Rehearse the seam.** Before the migration arrives, prototype governance, pricing, and org design for the next era. Run small sandboxes to learn the policy and technical muscles you will need.

6) **Institutionalize stewardship.** Each era widens what society expects you to safeguard. Treat stewardship as a designed discipline—roles, metrics, accountabilities—not as a value statement.

## Conclusion
Power migrates with scarcity. Each era elevates a distinct bottleneck and builds institutions to control it: suppressing violence; organizing land and water; coordinating capital goods at scale; intermediating information and attention through networks. Leaders who correctly identify the live choke point in their sector can design work, governance, and strategy to the constraint that actually rules outcomes. Those who mistake the era optimize the wrong variable and eventually cede power to those who understand where leverage now lives.

The four-era hypothesis is not a rigid chronology but a diagnostic lens. Most sectors exhibit hybrid logics; many firms straddle eras. The job is to locate where power sits **today**, see where it is **moving**, and reshape roles, metrics, and investment so that capability, capacity, and levels of work are tuned to the system’s real limit. Do that, and the organization stops fighting yesterday’s friction and starts compounding tomorrow’s advantage.

## Evolution of Organizational Capability

[Knowledge Base](https://josejruiz.com/knowledge-base/) > [Organizational Design and Development](https://josejruiz.com/organizational-design-and-development/)

By Jose J. Ruiz

## Understanding the Six Stages of The Organization

Organizations, like living systems, evolve through developmental stages. Each stage represents a distinct pattern of capability—how complexity is handled, how work is structured, and how decisions are made. Growth is not merely expansion in size or market presence; it is an increase in coherence, systemic strength, and adaptive capacity. The Organizational Stages Framework describes this journey from vision to institutional renewal, revealing how individual capability and organizational structure must stay aligned for performance to remain sustainable.
### Stage Zero: Visionary Genesis  
Every organization begins as an idea carried by belief. Stage Zero is the realm of founders—visionaries who see possibility before systems exist. There are no departments, no job descriptions, no formal structure—only intent and energy. The founder’s capability defines the organization’s boundaries. Decision-making is intuitive, anchored in proximity and trust. Success at this stage depends on the founder’s ability to inspire commitment, attract early collaborators, and translate vision into first action. Fragility is inherent; without structure, the organization’s survival depends entirely on the founder’s sustained drive and judgment.
### Stage One: Early Framework  
Structure begins to emerge. What was once pure intent now takes form through the first processes, roles, and routines. The organization starts building its “early framework,” transforming personal effort into a repeatable system. The founder begins to delegate—not because of preference, but necessity. Communication remains direct, and culture is deeply personal, reflecting the founder’s style and values. Yet the very informality that enables agility also limits scalability. Stage One organizations succeed by creating clarity—defining accountability, codifying routines, and establishing the first scaffolding for growth.
### Stage Two: Growth Acceleration  
Momentum takes over. Demand rises, opportunity multiplies, and expansion tests the limits of the early framework. Stage Two is characterized by tension between speed and structure. Systems that once served well begin to strain under volume and diversity. The leadership challenge is not vision, but prioritization and coordination. The founder’s instinct must evolve into shared management; intuition must coexist with planning. This is where many organizations lose coherence—pursuing every opportunity instead of designing growth intentionally. Those that succeed in Stage Two build stronger mechanisms for coordination, establish middle management, and begin to formalize strategic direction.
### Stage Three: Operational Maturity  
Discipline replaces improvisation. The organization’s focus shifts from chasing growth to mastering execution. Systems stabilize, roles clarify, and performance becomes measurable. Stage Three is the era of operational maturity—when management layers, defined processes, and institutional routines create predictability. The culture of heroics that powered early growth gives way to a culture of reliability and accountability. Success here depends on building leaders who can manage complexity at scale—translating strategy into operational excellence. Yet maturity brings new risk: rigidity. The challenge becomes maintaining adaptability without sacrificing consistency.
### Stage Four: Strategic Coherence  
At Stage Four, the organization learns to think and act as a single, coherent system. Strategy becomes integrative—linking foresight, governance, and ethics into a unified framework. The leadership challenge shifts from efficiency to direction. Decisions now span years, not quarters. Governance structures mature, enabling checks and balances between ambition and risk. Leadership succession, values alignment, and culture become strategic levers. The organization begins to see itself not merely as a business but as an institution—one whose role extends beyond performance to stewardship. This is where strategic coherence transforms management systems into enduring architecture.
### Stage Five: Adaptive Renewal  
Maturity without renewal becomes decay. Stage Five organizations master the rhythm of reinvention. They operate as adaptive systems—learning, sensing, and evolving continuously. Bureaucracy gives way to agility, but not by dismantling structure; rather, by embedding renewal into it. These organizations balance stability with transformation, creating feedback loops that connect governance, leadership, and innovation. Purpose becomes a living compass, not a statement. They renew not only strategy and systems but also identity—evolving in ways that preserve coherence while embracing change. At this stage, management, leadership, and stewardship are coherent and in balance.

---
## The Developmental Arc of Capability  
Progress through the stages is neither automatic nor linear. Many organizations stall, regress, or collapse when their structures fail to keep pace with their complexity. Growth requires synchrony between three elements: individual capability, organizational capability, and organizational capacity. When leaders overreach beyond the organization’s structural maturity, they create fragility; when structures outgrow the leadership’s cognitive depth, they create stagnation. The health of an organization depends on continuous alignment and renewal between what it can design, what it can organize, what it can execute, and what it can sustain.

Each stage deepens the organization’s ability to handle complexity:
- Stage Zero and One rely on **individual capability**.
- Stage Two and Three depend on **organizational capability**—the systems that convert personal effort into institutional performance.
- Stage Four and Five reflect **institutional capability**—the ability to sustain coherence, direction, and renewal beyond any one leader.

The stages therefore form not a ladder but an ecology of maturity, where every new layer builds upon but does not erase the previous one. Vision remains essential, but vision alone cannot substitute for structure. Structure enables growth, but structure without renewal breeds rigidity. Renewal sustains purpose, but only when anchored in coherent systems that preserve trust and identity over time.

---
## The Purpose of the Framework  
The Organizational Stages Framework offers more than a developmental map—it provides a diagnostic lens for understanding where an organization truly stands. It allows leaders to see beyond symptoms and recognize the structural causes of stagnation, friction, or fragility. A company struggling with chaos may not have a strategy problem but a Stage One structure trying to manage Stage Two complexity. A business drowning in process may not lack innovation—it may be trapped in Stage Three discipline without Stage Four direction. The framework restores perspective, reminding leaders that every structure was once liberating, and every liberation eventually demands new structure.

Ultimately, the stages describe not just organizational evolution, but human evolution within organizations. They remind us that growth is a design problem—one that asks leaders to build architectures capable of absorbing complexity without losing meaning. In that sense, organizational development is not about control or scale. It is about coherence—the capacity to evolve without breaking the very fabric that holds purpose, people, and performance together.

## Growing Capability Across Individual, Organizational, and Institutional Layers

[Knowledge Base](https://josejruiz.com/knowledge-base/) > [Organizational Design and Development](https://josejruiz.com/organizational-design-and-development/)

## Excerpt
Capability compounds when personal judgment becomes shared system strength and then matures into institutional coherence; growth remains healthy when it is synchronized across immediate execution, strategic change, and enduring identity—and when its human limits under uncertainty are respected.

## Abstract
Individual capability concerns reliable judgment under uncertainty across a defined time span; organizational capability concerns the systemic strength that multiplies many people’s judgment; institutional capability concerns the persistence of identity and renewal across generations. Development proceeds as translation: insight at the personal level is stabilized by organizational method and curated as institutional inheritance, then renewed. Capability is not limitless; neurobiological factors shape how much uncertainty a person can process at a given moment, how stress impairs prefrontal control, and how tolerance for ambiguity varies across individuals. Organizations can design roles, rhythms, and learning environments that expand effective tolerance (e.g., challenge–skill balance, immediate feedback, and supportive culture) while honoring hard bounds. Management, leadership, and stewardship serve as a supporting frame to keep horizons aligned as capability migrates up the stack.

## Introduction
Capability names the reliable power to handle complexity across time horizons; ability names present-tense skill; capacity names the breadth and volume at which ability and capability are expressed. Clear language prevents misdesign: scaling capacity without strengthening capability wastes resources; promoting ability into roles with greater horizons invites failure at transitions. Growth accelerates when translation mechanisms move insight cleanly between layers and when role demands are matched to cognitive requirements.

## Capability and Its Limits in Uncertainty
Biology constrains judgment under pressure. Prefrontal systems that support planning, inhibition, and working judgment degrade under stress-induced cortisol, biasing attention toward threat and narrowing cognitive bandwidth. Tolerance for ambiguity varies: some individuals maintain flexibility under stress; others default to simplification and risk avoidance. Role complexity and time horizon therefore must be matched to the person’s current operating level and potential growth.

Uncertainty tolerance is trainable only within bounds. Deliberate practices—graduated exposure to complexity (challenge–skill balance), immediate feedback, mindfulness and single-tasking, and autonomy within clear guardrails—help sustain prefrontal engagement and enable flow states that conserve resources through transient hypofrontality. Yet neurological predispositions remain a limiting factor; pushing beyond those limits harms well-being and decision quality.

## Definitions and Scope
Individual capability denotes a person’s dependable power to interpret ambiguity, recognize patterns, and choose under uncertainty across a given horizon. Organizational capability denotes the collective strength of structures, governance, and culture that support shared sense-making and adaptive execution. Institutional capability denotes embedded identity and legitimacy coupled with renewal mechanisms that preserve purpose while authorizing principled change. These layers are nested; personal judgment remains the seed, organizational method the multiplier, and institutional stewardship the carrier across generations.

## A Developmental Thesis: Migration Rather than Accumulation
Growth spreads through translation, not just added tools or headcount. Individuals generate new ways of seeing and deciding. Organizations stabilize those ways into principles, interfaces, and cadences that make results repeatable without heroics. Institutions generalize the durable parts into standards and norms, with amendment paths so living practice can update the canon as conditions shift. The supporting disciplines of management, leadership, and stewardship keep present reliability, future direction, and enduring identity in balance as capability migrates.

## Individual Capability: Personal Judgment Made Teachable
Judgment deepens as time span extends and variables are integrated rather than merely listed. Experience converts to capability when reasoning becomes portable—assumptions, decision criteria, and “if–then” heuristics made inspectable for others. Neurobiological hygiene matters: challenge–skill balance, single-tasking, and timely feedback reduce threat reactivity and support flow, preserving cognitive bandwidth for complexity. Role fit should honor the person’s current operating level and potential mode of thinking; stretch is productive when ambiguity grows gradually with support.

## Organizational Capability: Shared Strength under Complexity
Systemic strength appears when personal methods become properties of the organization. Operating models define end-to-end ownership, interfaces, and review cadences so reliability survives turnover and scale. Decision rights clarify who decides, on what criteria, and at which horizon, reducing rework and delay. Learning forums connect meaning-making to framing and solving so insights alter both design choices and daily routines. Environments that respect neurological limits—clear roles, graduated complexity, autonomy with guardrails, immediate feedback, and cultures that treat mistakes as learning—stabilize performance without suppressing initiative.

## Institutional Capability: Coherence that Endures and Renews
Institutional strength is coherence that persists and evolves. Identity and mission articulate what must remain intelligible across decades. Governance embeds standing commitments and defines how they change; culture stores stories that teach not only how to act but why it matters. Reliability platforms extend management work beyond cycles; re-articulation of arenas and advantage extends leadership work beyond tenures; safeguarding intergenerational value extends stewardship beyond the current coalition. Renewal depends on amendment procedures, sunset clauses, and succession architectures that develop leaders capable of reframing while maintaining trust.

## The Capability Migration Spiral
Development compounds through a repeating sequence—generate, stabilize, generalize, renew. Generation occurs when a practitioner reframes a consequential problem and proves an approach under varied conditions. Stabilization occurs when teams codify principles, define decision rights, and provision resources so results are reliable without exceptional effort. Generalization occurs when governance elevates tested patterns into standards aligned to identity and strategy, specifying where adaptation is encouraged and how exceptions are authorized. Renewal occurs when shifting realities reveal limits; fresh insight reopens framing, and principles are amended without severing continuity. Neuro-aware design keeps each turn humane and effective.

## Horizons as the Developmental Gradient
Time organizes growth. Individuals extend the horizon they can hold while maintaining coherence of intent, criteria, and consequence. Organizations knit multiple horizons into a direction stack where today’s execution, next year’s redesign, and multi-year platform building do not cannibalize one another. Institutions steward multi-decade commitments so identity and social trust withstand shocks. Matching horizon to role complexity is essential where stress and ambiguity tolerance are unevenly distributed.

## Interfaces that Preserve Meaning at Hand-Offs
Healthy hand-offs specify what is known, what is provisional, and what questions remain. The individual-to-organizational interface translates heuristics into principles with applicability conditions, preventing cargo-cult adoption. Decision logs that capture reasoning allow teams to reuse logic when circumstances shift. The organizational-to-institutional interface elevates norms into standards that constrain abuse without smothering craft; charters define who can grant exceptions and how evidence triggers revision. Reverse hand-offs move contradictions from policy to pilots and from organizational learning back to craft.

## Learning Architecture that Compounds Growth
Learning becomes architecture when feedback travels on purpose-built channels. Short-cycle operational reviews keep reliability honest; strategy forums test whether directional choices are clear enough for distributed adaptation; constitutional reviews examine whether enduring commitments remain rightly specified in light of lived consequences. Immediate feedback and psychological safety help maintain prefrontal engagement; archives that bind evidence, intent, and rationale give later actors the context needed to extend capability rather than rediscover it.

## Culture as Carrier and Compiler
Culture carries what systems cannot specify in advance and compiles narratives into norms. Stories of disciplined execution reinforce management virtues; stories of reframed bets reinforce leadership courage; stories of principled refusals reinforce stewardship character. Cultures that treat mistakes as data, not disgrace, increase tolerance for uncertainty and enable flow, turning learning into a social reflex.

## Practical Roadmap
- **Role–complexity fit.** Calibrate roles to the Levels of Work and an individual’s current operating level; expand complexity incrementally with support.  
- **Challenge–skill balance.** Sequence work to maintain flow while preventing overload; pair autonomy with clear guardrails and immediate feedback.  
- **Single-tasking and recovery.** Reduce multitasking and protect recovery windows to preserve cognitive bandwidth for judgment.  
- **Translation forums.** Connect meaning-making to framing and solving so learning changes design and routine, not just reports.  
- **Renewal mechanisms.** Use amendment procedures, sunset clauses, and succession architectures to keep doctrine living while protecting identity.

## Conclusion
Capability grows when judgment becomes teachable method and method becomes stewarded inheritance. Individuals contribute the source of renewal—sense-making, framing, and principled choice under uncertainty. Organizations convert that source into system properties—operating models, decision rights, and cultural norms that multiply judgment. Institutions preserve and renew coherence—identity, legitimacy, and governance that carry purpose across generations while authorizing principled change. Growth is strongest when designs respect human limits in uncertainty, expand effective tolerance through practice and support, and synchronize present reliability, future direction, and enduring identity.

## Levels of Work

[Knowledge Base](https://josejruiz.com/knowledge-base/) > [Organizational Design and Development](https://josejruiz.com/organizational-design-and-development/)

By Jose J. Ruiz

---
## Excerpt  
Clarity about the level at which work is done prevents two costly errors—assigning people to roles that ask for more judgment than they can hold, and designing roles that demand less judgment than the system requires. Levels of Work offer a neutral language for calibrating complexity, time span, and accountability so talent, structure, and strategy align.

---

## Abstract  
Levels of Work define the hierarchy of complexity in organizations by specifying the scale, scope, and **time span of discretion** expected at each layer of contribution. The construct emerged from **Elliott Jaques’s** Stratified Systems Theory, which demonstrated that effective organizations differentiate roles by the length of time over which judgment must be exercised to deliver results. **Gillian Stamp** advanced the practice through the **Mode of Thinking** model and **Career Path Appreciation (CPA)**, providing disciplined ways to appreciate current and emerging capability and to align individuals with roles that match the complexity they can hold.

This paper introduces the logic of Levels of Work; clarifies relationships among **capability** (judgment across time), **ability** (present skill), and **capacity** (scale and scope of application); outlines the entry levels and transitional thresholds; and shows how to apply the construct to role design, succession, and governance. The intent is a shared language that enables coherent organizational design and humane talent decisions.

---

## Introduction  
Complexity, not status, is the organizing principle of modern work. Work that differs in uncertainty, interdependence, and horizon cannot be coordinated with a single logic of supervision or a single vocabulary of performance. Levels of Work name discrete bands of complexity and their corresponding time spans so that judgment requirements in roles are explicit and people are asked to exercise judgment at a level they can reliably sustain.

Jaques established the theoretical spine: roles differ primarily by **time span of discretion**—the length of time a role holder must hold uncertainty before results can be meaningfully evaluated. Stamp extended this with a developmental account of how people think at increasing levels of complexity (Mode of Thinking) and with an assessment practice (CPA) that appreciates emerging capability over time. Together, these contributions connect structure with human development in a way that is rigorous and humane.

## Foundational Vocabulary

### Capability  
Power to navigate complexity through judgment, sense-making, and meaning-making across time horizons. Capability speaks to how a person holds ambiguity, integrates variables, and anticipates consequences. Capability develops over time and sets the upper bound of complexity an individual can reliably carry.

### Ability  
Present, demonstrable skill and know-how—what can be executed now. Ability is grounded in applied knowledge and experience and changes with training, practice, and feedback.

### Capacity  
Scale, scope, and volume with which ability and capability can be applied—how much, how broad, how many. Capacity can be expanded through team design, tooling, process, and governance.

### Time Span of Discretion  
Length of time a role holder must sustain judgment before outcomes can be evaluated. Time span provides the most reliable measure of the level of work demanded by a role.

### Triad of Direction  
Three complementary disciplines guide organizational life across horizons. **Management** organizes work and ensures execution within known systems (present horizon). **Leadership** creates direction and alignment amid change (future horizon). **Stewardship** safeguards identity and continuity across time (enduring horizon). All three operate at every level, with different emphasis as horizon stretches.

---

## The Logic of Levels of Work

### Level of Work 1 — Quality  
Work is concrete, immediate, and procedural. Emphasis rests on accuracy, compliance, and tangible outputs within clear methods. Typical time span ranges from **one day to three months**. Roles include frontline operators, technicians, and assistants producing visible outputs against defined standards.
### Level of Work 2 — Service  
Work converts plans into coordinated action. Emphasis rests on scheduling, sequencing, and tailoring responses within policy. Typical time span extends to **three to twelve months**. Roles include team leads, unit coordinators, and supervisors translating methods into repeatable service.
### Level of Work 3 — Practice  
Work refines and integrates methods across value streams. Emphasis rests on diagnosing patterns, improving flow, and balancing efficiency with reliability. Typical time span ranges from **one to two years** for systemic improvement, with shorter cycles for operational tuning. Roles include functional managers, practice leads, and heads of continuous improvement.
### Level of Work 4 — Strategic Development  
Work designs and scales systems that align resources, processes, and people to longer-term objectives. Emphasis rests on architecture, sequencing programs, and integrating interdependent functions. Typical time span stretches from **two to five years**. Roles include general managers, business architects, and enterprise-wide program leaders.
### Level of Work 5 — Strategic Intent  
Work shapes the direction, viability, and resilience of the enterprise across multi-year horizons. Emphasis rests on shaping context, choosing bets, and balancing adaptability with coherence. Typical time span extends from **five to ten years**. Roles include enterprise executives and board-facing leaders who carry institution-level consequences.
### Level of Work 6: Corporate Citizenship
Focuses on guiding the organization as a responsible, ethical, and value-creating institution within society. Work involves shaping culture, governance, and social contribution to sustain trust and legitimacy. The time span—10 to 20 years—emphasizes stewardship, societal alignment, and enduring impact beyond immediate business performance.
### Level of Work 7: Corporate Prescience
Envisions the organization’s role within evolving global systems, anticipating transformations in society, technology, and ecology. Work at this level safeguards long-term coherence, guiding purpose across generations. The time span—20 to 50 years—focuses on foresight, institutional legacy, and shaping conditions for future relevance and renewal.

---

## Cognitive Basis: Jaques and Stamp

### Jaques and Stratified Systems Theory  
Stratified Systems Theory argues that organizations function best when roles are designed with explicit time spans and when individuals are placed where their judgment can sustain those spans. The central claim is structural and predictive: coherent alignment of roles to time span reduces friction, clarifies accountability, and improves throughput.

### Stamp’s Mode of Thinking  
Stamp explained why individuals cope differently with complexity by describing developmental modes that align with increasing strata of work. The **Declarative** mode works with concrete facts and immediate procedures. The **Cumulative** mode links steps into repeatable sequences. The **Serial** mode manages linear systems over extended cycles. The **Parallel** mode integrates multiple interdependencies over years and across systems. These modes describe how individuals hold and organize complexity, offering a language for appreciating emerging capability.

### Career Path Appreciation (CPA)  
CPA is a structured, dialogic method that reveals how a person structures time and complexity. The process estimates a person’s **current operating level** and **future mode**, informing development and succession without deterministic labeling or pass/fail scoring. CPA complements, rather than replaces, evaluation and other decision processes.

---

## Linking Capability, Ability, and Capacity  
Capability determines the upper bound of complexity and time a person can hold reliably. Ability expresses present execution of skills and methods. Capacity scales both across breadth, volume, and scope. Misalignment among the three produces predictable failure modes.

When capability exceeds ability, a person sees the right game but lacks the skills to play it; development should target specific methods and practice. When ability exceeds capability, a person executes expertly yet struggles as horizon and ambiguity expand; development should target sense-making, judgment, and the disciplined extension of time span. When capability and ability exceed capacity, a person performs well locally but stalls when scope multiplies; system scaffolding, team design, and tooling must extend reach.

---

## Decision Making Across Horizons  
Decision rights follow complexity. Work in the known-controlled space benefits from standardization and tight feedback. Work in unknown-controllable space calls for experimentation, short learning loops, and explicit risk framing. Work in unknown-uncontrolled contexts demands sensing, resilience, and stewardship, with slower, institution-level feedback cycles. Leaders iterate across these contexts as signals accumulate, continually matching the decision method to the level of work and horizon involved.

## Assessment, Evaluation, and Appreciation

### Assessment  
Assessment is a structured, diagnostic process for understanding the current state and future ability and capacity. Assessment gathers evidence; it does not assign value or carry consequences.

### Evaluation  
Evaluation applies judgment against defined criteria, compares evidence to benchmarks, and carries consequences. Evaluation is the formal decision step that supports accountability.

### Appreciation  
Appreciation is a qualitative, interpretive judgment about how a person makes sense of complexity across longer time spans. Appreciation estimates current and emerging **capability**, anticipates transition points, and informs role fit and development. Appreciation does not use scores and is never pass/fail.

### Using the Three Disciplines in Sequence  
Assessment informs by collecting structured evidence. Evaluation decides by applying criteria and accepting consequences. Appreciation interprets how the person holds complexity over time so growth and placement remain humane and accurate.

## Thresholds and Transitions

### Transition from Level 2 (Service) to Level 3 (Practice)  
This transition expands the locus of attention from local coordination to system performance. The leader shifts from optimizing a team’s plan to diagnosing patterns across value streams, instituting standards, and stabilizing flow. Stretch experiences include ownership of cross-functional improvement, responsibility for measurement systems, and stewardship of end-to-end quality.

### Transition from Level 3 (Practice) to Level 4 (Strategic Development)  
This transition shifts from method refinement to system architecture. The contributor begins to integrate multiple functions, sequence multi-year programs, and design operating models. Stretch experiences include platform redesign, portfolio-level resource allocation, and interface governance across functions.

### Transition from Level 4 (Strategic Development) to Level 5 (Strategic Intent)  
This transition enlarges horizon and consequence. The leader shapes context rather than only optimizing within it, balancing foresight with resilience. Stretch experiences include corporate strategy formation, enterprise risk framing, external stakeholder stewardship, and succession planning for institutional roles.

## Organizational Design with Levels of Work

### Role Architecture  
Role design begins by articulating the nature of work: the inherent complexity, interdependence, and time span of discretion. Clear roles specify the judgment to be exercised, the interfaces to be integrated, and the cadence at which evidence of results becomes meaningful. Level definitions serve as a checklist to confirm fit between the work and the expected time horizon.

### Vertical Layering and Horizontal Coupling  
Vertical design locates who holds which horizon; horizontal design governs how functions interlock. Healthy systems minimize gaps and overlaps in time span, ensuring that adjacent roles either share a horizon by design or hand off work cleanly across horizons. Interfaces are explicit, with decision rights calibrated to the complexity of the dependency.

### Governance and Stewardship  
At higher levels, stewardship becomes explicit. The work safeguards identity, license, and legitimacy across decades. Policies encode ethical standards; strategy incorporates societal expectations; succession protects purpose as individuals rotate. Stewardship disciplines ensure the enterprise honors commitments to customers, employees, owners, and communities over the enduring horizon.

---

## Implementation Roadmap

### Step 1: Name the Work  
Describe outcomes, interdependencies, and the time span of discretion. State the judgment calls that matter and how evidence of results will appear over time.

### Step 2: Calibrate the Horizon  
Place the role within the present, future, or enduring horizon. Anticipate the interfaces and governance needs that accompany this placement.

### Step 3: Specify Decision Rights  
Map routine, experimental, and emergent decisions to appropriate methods. Define escalation paths that reflect complexity rather than status.

### Step 4: Use Assessment, Evaluation, and Appreciation in Sequence  
Run **assessment** to diagnose the current state and future ability and capacity. Run **evaluation** to compare evidence to criteria and make consequential decisions. Run **appreciation** to interpret how the person makes sense of complexity over time, estimate current and emerging capability, and anticipate transition points; omit scores and pass/fail labels.

### Step 5: Align Development  
Target the correct domain. Build **ability** with training, methods, and practice. Stretch **capability** by extending time span with scaffolded responsibilities. Expand **capacity** through team design, tooling, and process that multiply individual contribution.

### Step 6: Design Scaffolding  
Install operating rhythms, information flows, and enabling technologies that sustain performance at the intended level of work. Ensure that individuals do not carry systemic load alone.

---

## Common Failure Modes

### Title-Based Layering  
Job titles masquerade as complexity labels. Decision rights remain unclear; execution oscillates between over-control and drift. Level definitions restore judgment-based differentiation.

### Ability–Capability Confusion  
Skill gaps are mistaken for limited potential, or potential is mistaken for readiness. Distinguishing ability, capability, and capacity prevents misdiagnosis and rework.

### Feedback Conflation  
Assessment is prematurely used to make decisions; evaluation is avoided; appreciation is misused as recognition. Keeping the sequence clean preserves trust: assessment is diagnostic, evaluation applies criteria and carries consequences, appreciation interprets how the individual holds complexity over time to estimate current and emerging capability.

## Conclusion  
Levels of Work provide a neutral grammar for matching people, roles, and horizons. **Elliott Jaques** contributed the irreducible measure of **time span** as the basis for level; **Gillian Stamp** contributed the means to appreciate how people think their way into longer spans and to apply the construct through Mode of Thinking and CPA. When organizations design around judgment requirements, staff for fit to complexity, and govern for continuity across horizons, they reduce friction, accelerate learning, and compound advantage over time. The payoff is performance in the present, coherence across the future, and continuity along the enduring arc.

## How Management Horizons and Timespan of Discretion Shape Individual, Organizational, and Institutional Capability  

By Jose J. Ruiz  

## Excerpt  

When capability is understood as a set of **nested spaces**—individual, organizational, and institutional—an enterprise can deliberately design the conditions in which the next level of capability can flourish. Governance, including a well-constructed highest-level mandate, becomes a core tool for shaping the tone and reach of institutional capability. The quality of those who manage, lead, and steward that mandate—and the timespan of discretion over which they are authorized to decide—determines whether the organization enjoys a living space for renewing purpose and strategic intent, or merely a static frame that constrains growth.  

## Abstract  

This article examines the nested nature of capability at three levels: individual, organizational, and institutional. Rather than viewing capability as an aggregate of skills or systems, it presents capability as a hierarchy of **spaces**—each level creating the conditions under which the next can develop and contribute.  

Individual capability is the foundation: the depth of judgment that enables sense-making and meaning-making under uncertainty, exercised over a given **timespan of discretion**. Organizational capability is the system-level coherence that coordinates and multiplies that judgment across the **Present and Future Horizons**. Institutional capability, expressed mainly through governance, is anchored in the **Enduring horizon**, defining the outer space within which the organization can act, evolve, and sustain legitimacy over time.  

The tone and reach of institutional capability are strongly influenced by the capability and timespan of discretion of those who manage, lead, and steward the highest-level mandate. Their sense-making and meaning-making at the institutional horizon shape how that mandate is interpreted, how widely it travels, and how much space it creates for ongoing renewal of strategic intent and purpose.  

Within this architecture, governance instruments such as shareholder and board mandates are not the focus but essential tools. They shape the outer space for the **Triad of Direction**—management, leadership, stewardship—to function coherently across horizons. From there, strategic development and strategic deployment nest inside these spaces and timeframes, allowing capability to migrate and grow rather than remaining trapped in individuals or moments.  

## Introduction  

Capability is often discussed as if it were a list: leadership competency frameworks, organizational capabilities, institutional strengths. These lists have their uses, but they miss two fundamental realities. Capability is not simply a set of attributes; it is an **environmental condition**—and it is inherently **temporal**.  

People do not exercise their full capability in a vacuum. They do it in a space defined by expectations, freedoms, boundaries, consequences, and the **time horizon** over which they are trusted to make decisions. Organizations do not coordinate complexity by accident; they do so within a space created by design choices, culture, governance, and the **Management Horizons** of Present and Future. Institutions do not renew themselves spontaneously; they do so within a space shaped by purpose, mandate, stewardship, and the **Enduring horizon**.  

This article reframes capability as a set of **nested spaces linked to distinct timespans of discretion**:  

- The **individual space**, where personal sense-making and meaning-making occur over the specific timespan of discretion of a role.  
- The **organizational space**, where structures and processes enable collective action across the Present and Future horizons.  
- The **institutional space**, where the highest-level mandate, governance, and stewardship define the Enduring frame within which all other horizons must cohere.  

Within this nesting, the highest-level mandate plays a crucial, but not central, role. It is one of the core tools by which the institutional space is defined. The tone and reach of that space are heavily influenced by the capability and timespan of discretion of those who manage, lead, and steward the mandate—typically the board, key owners, and the top executive leadership.  

When their capability is high, and their timespan is aligned to the Enduring horizon, they create a generous but disciplined space in which strategic intent and purpose can be continually renewed. Within that space, organizational and individual capability can flourish at their appropriate horizons.  

## The Three Layers of Capability as Nested Spaces  

### Individual Space: The Locus of Sense-Making, Meaning-Making, and Timespan  

Individual capability is the power to hold and work with complexity over time. It is expressed in how a person makes sense of ambiguous situations, assigns meaning to events and choices, and maintains a coherent intention while conditions shift.  

Each individual operates within a personal **space of judgment** shaped by their cognitive range, emotional maturity, ethical frame, and—critically—their **timespan of discretion**: the longest time horizon over which they are expected and authorized to use their judgment without further approval. For some roles this may be days or weeks; for others it may be years.  

This individual space is where new interpretations first appear. Someone notices a weak signal in the market, an erosion of trust in a critical relationship, or a mismatch between stated values and actual behavior. Their sense-making organizes the signal; their meaning-making links it to what the organization is and intends to be over the relevant time horizon.  

When the timespan of discretion for a role is too short for the complexity it faces, capable individuals are forced into reactive behavior. They see long-term implications but are constrained to short-term actions. When timespan and complexity are aligned, people can hold emerging patterns long enough to frame them properly and bring them into the organizational and institutional conversations that matter.  

Without this personal space, aligned to a realistic timespan, nothing higher in the system truly evolves. But if the system stops here—if insight remains trapped inside individuals—the enterprise becomes dependent on a small number of people and is highly vulnerable when they leave or lose influence.  

### Organizational Space: Designing Timespan and Horizons for Collective Performance  

Organizational capability emerges when the enterprise creates a **shared space** in which many individuals can coordinate their judgment and action across the Present and Future Management Horizons.  

This space is defined by role and mandate design, decision rights and escalation paths, information flows and operating rhythms, and cultural norms around learning, conflict, and accountability. Embedded in each of these is an implicit or explicit allocation of **timespan of discretion**: who is expected to think and act over what period, and with what level of autonomy.  

At the **Present horizon**, roles focus on reliable execution—daily operations, near-term service levels, short-cycle risk management. Their timespan of discretion is correspondingly short, and the organizational space must support rapid, high-quality decisions at that scale.  

At the **Future horizon**, roles focus on change—strategy formulation, portfolio shifts, transformation programs, capability-building. Their timespan of discretion is longer, often spanning multiple planning cycles. The organizational space here must allow leaders to hold and work with multi-year patterns, experiment within bounded risk, and redesign the system without being pulled back into purely present-tense firefighting.  

Organizational capability, then, is not only about what the organization can do; it is about the **room it creates for different timespans of discretion to coexist and interact**. When the organizational space is well designed, individuals can operate near the top of their capability and time horizon, contribute meaningfully to broader decisions, and see how their work connects to strategic intent and the Enduring commitments of the institution.  

When it is poorly designed—when every role is forced into the same short-term horizon—both present performance and future viability suffer. People spend their time compensating for structural weaknesses rather than creating value.  

### Institutional Space: The Enduring Frame for Horizons and Timespans  

Institutional capability operates at the longest horizon. It is the enterprise’s enduring guardianship of identity, legitimacy, and adaptability over time.  

The institutional space is defined primarily by purpose and long-term orientation, owner expectations and the highest-level mandate, governance structures and processes, and boundaries for risk-taking, ethical conduct, and social responsibility. It is anchored in the **Enduring Management Horizon**, where the relevant timespan of discretion may extend across leadership tenures, economic cycles, and even generations.  

This outer space sets the conditions within which organizational and individual spaces must operate. It answers questions such as what has been promised to stakeholders about who the organization is and how it behaves; which trade-offs are acceptable or unacceptable in pursuit of performance; and how continuity of identity is reconciled with the need to change.  

If the institutional space is incoherent, restrictive, overly short-term, or vague about timespans, it constrains or confuses the spaces below it. If it is thoughtfully designed and periodically renewed, it provides the psychological, strategic, and temporal room needed for the organization and its people to innovate and grow without losing their bearings.  

## Spaces as Decision-Making Environments Across Time  

These nested spaces are, at their core, **decision-making environments**—especially for decisions under volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. What makes a space powerful is not only the roles and structures that occupy it, but the quality of decision-making it makes possible at the **appropriate timespan and horizon**.  

In such conditions, decisions cannot be reduced to choosing among pre-defined options. They require a **Progression of Meaningful Response**:  

1. **Sense-Making**—asking “What is happening?” and orienting in volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity at the time horizon that matters.  
2. **Meaning-Making**—asking “What does this mean?” and connecting events to purpose, values, and identity at the relevant Management Horizon.  
3. **Framing**—asking “What do we need to solve?” and defining the real challenge, including its temporal dimension: what must be solved now, what can wait, what must be watched over years. 
4. **Solving**—asking “How do we solve this?” and moving from clarity to coherent action within the timespan of discretion available to the decision-maker.  

Each space—individual, organizational, and institutional—provides a frame within which this progression can occur, be shared, and be refined over time. At the individual level, the progression is bounded by personal timespan of discretion. At the organizational level, it becomes a shared process across Present and Future horizons. At the institutional level, it connects Enduring commitments with near-term and medium-term choices.  

At every level, these decision-making spaces are held in place by a **Tripod of Work** that clarifies what work is to be done, how it should be done, and why it matters over time. In lived experience, this shows up as how people are tasked, trusted, and tended: how they are tasked shapes what decisions they are expected and authorized to make and over what timespan; how they are trusted shapes the discretion and judgment they can actually exercise; and how they are tended—through feedback, development, and support—shapes how their judgment and time horizon grow.  

Alongside this tripod, a strong awareness of **SIPOC**—the suppliers, inputs, processes, outputs, and customers connected to a given decision—grounds each space in the concrete flow of value. When decision-makers at any level can see their SIPOC clearly, and place it within the correct horizon, they can situate their sense-making and meaning-making: they understand who is upstream and downstream from their choices, what is being affected, and over what timespan consequences will unfold.  

When the Tripod of Work and SIPOC awareness are both strong, and tuned to realistic timespans, each space becomes a deliberate environment for judgment rather than a stage for improvisation.  

## Tone and Reach of Institutional Capability  

The institutional space is not neutral. It has a **tone**—how it feels to those who inhabit it—and a **reach**—how far its influence extends through the system and across horizons. Both are heavily influenced by the capability and timespan of discretion of those who manage, lead, and steward the highest-level mandate.  

Tone is the qualitative character of institutional capability. It is conveyed through the behavior of the board, key shareholders, and top executives as they interpret and apply the mandate over long timespans. The same formal mandate can produce different tones depending on whether stewards are genuinely thinking in the Enduring horizon or are pulled back into short-termism.  

Reach is the extent to which institutional capability actually shapes behavior throughout the organization and across stakeholder relationships. High-capability stewards with an authentic Enduring timespan expand reach by translating the mandate into clear expectations for strategy, risk, and conduct across Present and Future horizons; ensuring that governance decisions cascade into organizational design and priorities; and engaging with management and leadership in ways that make institutional intent visible and actionable at all timespans.  

In practical terms, tone and reach together determine whether institutional capability functions as a living, guiding space or as a distant, symbolic layer. The higher the capability and the more appropriate the timespan of discretion of those who steward the mandate, the more the institutional space becomes an enabling environment for the renewal of strategic intent and purpose.  

## Governance and the Highest-Level Mandate as Enabling Space  

Within this framework, governance tools—especially a well-crafted shareholder and board mandate—play a specific role: they shape the **Enduring space** without becoming the center of the story.  

The highest-level mandate defines the outer boundaries of what the organization can and cannot do in pursuit of value; articulates priorities among growth, resilience, responsibility, and innovation; and creates formal space for the periodic review and renewal of purpose and strategic intent at an Enduring timespan.  

This third function is often underappreciated. A mandate at the institutional level should not freeze purpose and strategy; it should **require their renewal**. It should create explicit room—through review cycles, board dialogues, and stakeholder engagement—for the organization to ask whether current strategic intent and operating models still reflect realities and commitments, and whether the formal purpose still resonates with stakeholders and employees.  

The capability and timespan of discretion of those who manage, lead, and steward this mandate determine whether such reviews are perfunctory or genuinely transformative. High-capability stewards turn the mandate into a renewable space: a place where new interpretations, new strategic possibilities, and deeper expressions of purpose can emerge and be integrated without breaking continuity.  

## The Triad of Direction Within Nested Horizons and Spaces  

Within the institutional space defined and stewarded through the mandate, the **Triad of Direction**—management, leadership, and stewardship—organizes capability across spaces and Management Horizons.  

Management has its center of gravity in the organizational space and the Present horizon, focusing on operational reliability and near-term performance within the timespan of discretion of frontline and mid-level roles.  

Leadership spans the organizational and institutional spaces across the Future and Present horizons. It translates purpose and mandate into strategic intent, designs the organization to realize that intent, and holds a timespan of discretion that encompasses multiple operating cycles.  

Stewardship resides chiefly in the institutional space and the Enduring horizon, ensuring continuity of identity and legitimacy while enabling renewal across generations of leadership. Its timespan of discretion is the longest in the system.  

Each element of the Triad occupies its own space and horizon and, crucially, **creates space for the next level of capability to flourish**. Stewardship interpreted through a high-capability, long-timespan mandate creates the outer space in which leadership can explore new strategic directions without violating core commitments. Leadership, when capable and time-appropriate, designs organizational spaces where management can execute effectively and where individuals can grow. Management, when thoughtful, creates local spaces of autonomy and learning where individual capability and timespan can stretch.  

The nested nature of these spaces and timespans means that capability is not simply top-down or bottom-up. It is **relational across horizons**: each level depends on the quality of the space created by the level above and the energy and insight contributed by the level below.  

## From Spaces to Flows: Strategic Development and Deployment  

Once the institutional tone and reach are set, the timespans are aligned to the Management Horizons, and the Triad of Direction is functioning, strategic development and deployment become flows within and between the nested spaces.  

Strategic development occurs mainly at the interface of leadership and stewardship, spanning the Future and Enduring horizons. It involves interpreting changes in context through the lens of purpose and mandate, renewing or reframing strategic intent, and defining where and how the organization will play and win across multi-year timespans.  

Strategic deployment occurs primarily in the organizational space under the guidance of management, informed by leadership, across the Present and shorter Future horizons. It involves translating strategic intent into structures, roles, resource allocations, operating models, and performance systems appropriate to the timespan of discretion of each role.  

As these flows repeat, capability migrates. Insights from individual spaces, often generated at shorter timespans, are tested in organizational forums that operate over longer horizons, then absorbed into institutional governance where appropriate. Institutional decisions, in turn, reshape organizational and individual spaces, allowing new capability and extended timespans of discretion to emerge.  

## Six Organizational Stages of Capability Maturity  

The nested architecture of spaces and horizons does not appear fully formed. It develops over time through recognizable **organizational stages**, each reflecting a different level of strength and maturity in institutional and organizational capability, and a different balance of reliance on individual capability.  

At **Stage 1**, the organization is largely **founder- or hero-driven**. Most meaningful capability lives in a few individuals whose timespan of discretion informally stretches far beyond their formal roles. Organizational systems are minimal, and institutional governance is embryonic. The enterprise functions because certain people can hold complexity; if they leave, capability collapses.  

At **Stage 2**, basic structures, roles, and routines begin to form. Organizational capability is still fragile, but there is more shared language about priorities and performance. The Present horizon starts to be managed systematically, yet the Future and Enduring horizons depend heavily on the intuition and judgment of a small leadership group.  

At **Stage 3**, the organization develops **repeatable processes and clearer accountability**. The Present horizon is robust, and the Future horizon is formally acknowledged through planning and project portfolios. Institutional capability is still modest, but governance structures have taken shape. Individual capability is no longer the only source of coherence, though it remains a critical stabilizer.  

At **Stage 4**, the organization becomes an **integrated system**. Cross-functional coordination, explicit strategy, and feedback loops connect the Present and Future horizons. Governance is more active and begins to anchor decisions in an emerging Enduring frame. Organizational capability is strong enough that no single individual is indispensable, even as individual capability continues to drive innovation and renewal.  

At **Stage 5**, the enterprise is a **fully institutionalized organization**. Purpose, mandate, and governance are clear and consistently applied. Institutional capability at the Enduring horizon is strong; it shapes strategy, design, and culture in visible ways. Organizational capability is mature across Present and Future horizons, and individual capability is developed and deployed within well-designed spaces and timespans of discretion.  

At **Stage 6**, the organization operates as a **regenerative institution**. It not only adapts to its context but actively shapes the ecosystems it is part of, while maintaining integrity with its purpose and commitments. Institutional capability is deeply anchored in the Enduring horizon but remains open and responsive. Organizational capability is agile and learning-driven, and individual capability is widely distributed, with roles and timespans consciously designed to cultivate the next generation of stewards.  

Across these six stages, the pattern is consistent:  

- In the **lower stages**, the enterprise is heavily dependent on **individual capability** to compensate for weak organizational and institutional structures. Timespans of discretion are often informal and uneven, and risk is concentrated in a few key people.  
- As the organization matures, **organizational capability** strengthens, spanning Present and Future horizons in a more deliberate way. Timespans of discretion become explicit and better aligned with the complexity of work.  
- At the highest stages, **institutional capability** becomes a stabilizing and enabling force, anchored in the Enduring horizon. The highest-level mandate and governance structures create a space where organizational and individual capability can continue to develop without over-reliance on any single actor.  

These stages provide a developmental lens on the nested architecture: they show how an enterprise can progressively move from heroics to system, from system to institution, and from institution to regeneration, by consciously building capability at all three levels and aligning them with appropriate management horizons and timespans of discretion.  

## Designing for Migration of Capability Across Horizons  

The ultimate test of this nested architecture is whether it supports the **migration of capability and timespan** over time. The goal is to allow individual capability to be recognized and used; to convert recurring patterns of insight into organizational method; and to elevate the most robust methods and principles into institutional norms and mandates at the Enduring horizon.  

In this design, high-capability individuals—especially those involved in managing, leading, and stewarding the highest-level mandate—play a dual role. They contribute their judgment to specific decisions within their timespan of discretion, and they help shape the spaces and horizons in which others can exercise and grow theirs.  

This is how the tone, reach, and temporal alignment of institutional capability become central levers of enterprise health. When the highest-level mandate is stewarded by people whose own capability is deep and integrated across horizons, they create nested spaces—institutional, organizational, and individual—in which the next level of capability and longer timespans of discretion can flourish.  

## Conclusion  

Capability in an enterprise is best understood as a **nested architecture of spaces and horizons**.  

Individual capability lives in the personal space of judgment, sense-making, and meaning-making, bounded by a specific timespan of discretion. Organizational capability resides in the designed space where many individuals coordinate to deliver complex outcomes across the Present and Future Management Horizons. Institutional capability is housed in the outer space defined by purpose, mandate, and governance, anchored in the Enduring horizon where identity and legitimacy are preserved and renewed.  

Governance tools—most notably the highest-level mandate—are not the focus, but they are essential. They shape the tone, reach, and temporal character of institutional capability. The people who manage, lead, and steward this mandate determine whether the institutional space is static and constraining, or dynamic and enabling. When their capability and timespan of discretion are well matched to the Enduring horizon, they create a space in which strategic intent and purpose can be regularly renewed, and in which organizational and individual capability can grow.  

Within this outer space, the Triad of Direction aligns present performance, future strategy, and enduring identity. Strategic development and strategic deployment become nested flows rather than isolated events. Capability and timespan are allowed to migrate: from individuals to organizations to institutions, and back again.  

Enterprises that design and steward these nested spaces and horizons intentionally are better equipped to perform, adapt, and endure. They do not rely on heroes or accidents. They rely on the careful cultivation of environments where the next level of capability—and the next level of time—can take root and flourish.

## Organizational Design - Finance in the Levels of Work System

[Knowledge Base](https://josejruiz.com/knowledge-base/) > [Organizational Design and Development](https://josejruiz.com/organizational-design-and-development/)

By Jose J. Ruiz

---

Finance in the Contribution Bands™ / Levels of Work system describes how the same discipline shows up very differently as complexity, time span, and institutional consequence increase.

Below is a level-by-level view for the **Finance and Resource Management** role across **Levels of Work 1–6**, aligned with the core description, mandate, and pillars.

---

## Level of Work 1 — Quality  
**Time span:** 1 day to ≈3 months  

Finance at Level 1 focuses on **transactional accuracy and timeliness** so higher levels can trust the base data.  

- **Nature of work:** Enter invoices, process expenses, post journal entries, issue customer invoices, apply cash, and reconcile simple accounts following clear rules and checklists.  
- **Mandate expression:** Turn raw activity into clean, coded transactions that reflect reality—no gaps, no guessing—so cash, revenue, and cost positions are visible every day and every close.  
- **Pillars in play:**  
  - **FP&A:** Provide timely, error-free data feeds (actuals, basic coding) that underpin budgeting and variance analysis.  
  - **Revenue & Profit:** Ensure invoices, discounts, credits, and taxes are applied correctly so unit economics are not distorted.  
  - **Treasury & Cash-Flow:** Post cash movements promptly; support daily cash-position views.  
  - **Asset Management:** Maintain accurate fixed-asset records (tags, basic depreciation runs) and inventory postings.  
  - **Risk & Compliance:** Follow procedures, controls, and documentation standards (e.g., approvals, three-way matches).  
- **Decision rights:** Choose the correct code or treatment within defined rules; escalate any exceptions, anomalies, or missing approvals.  
- **Typical roles:** AP/AR clerks, billing specialists, payroll processors, junior bookkeepers, entry-level accountants.  

---

## Level of Work 2 — Service  
**Time span:** ≈3 to 12 months  

Finance at Level 2 focuses on **coordinating the finance service model**—how transactional work, closing cycles, and basic reporting support internal customers.  

- **Nature of work:** Schedule and manage the close calendar, allocate work across the team, resolve routine issues with vendors and internal stakeholders, and ensure service-level commitments (e.g., payment terms, billing cycles) are met.  
- **Mandate expression:** Turn finance processes into a reliable service others can plan around—predictable closes, clear cut-offs, and responsive handling of routine exceptions.  
- **Pillars in play:**  
  - **FP&A:** Own short-cycle forecasts for specific cost centers or teams (e.g., monthly OPEX forecasts); provide first-pass variance explanations.  
  - **Revenue & Profit:** Monitor margin and pricing execution for specific products, channels, or regions; escalate recurring leakage.  
  - **Treasury & Cash-Flow:** Manage payment timing within policy; optimize vendor terms and collections at a local/unit level.  
  - **Asset Management:** Coordinate capex request workflows and ensure new assets are recorded, categorized, and depreciated correctly.  
  - **Risk & Compliance:** Enforce internal controls in day-to-day operations; prepare for audits at unit or department level.  
- **Decision rights:** Adjust schedules, prioritize workloads, and negotiate within policy (e.g., payment timing, credit holds) to balance cash, risk, and service.  
- **Typical roles:** Finance team leads, shared-services supervisors, payroll and AP/AR supervisors, local accounting leads in smaller business units.  

---

## Level of Work 3 — Practice  
**Time span:** ≈1 to 2 years, with shorter cycles for operational tuning  

Finance at Level 3 focuses on **building and refining the finance practice**—standardizing methods, improving quality of insight, and orchestrating cross-team processes.  

- **Nature of work:** Design and improve budgeting and forecasting routines, build management reports, harmonize charts of accounts across entities, and lead root-cause analysis of recurring variances.  
- **Mandate expression:** Turn finance from a reactive service into a **continuous-improvement engine** that stabilizes performance, tightens working capital, and gives leaders clearer, faster information.

## Organizational Stages Literature Review

[Knowledge Base](https://josejruiz.com/knowledge-base/) > [Organizational Design and Development](https://josejruiz.com/organizational-design-and-development/)

By Jose J. Ruiz

---
## Excerpt

Zero-to-One creativity becomes enduring excellence only when capability migrates from exceptional individuals into resilient systems; this paper codifies the six stages of that journey and shows how DOES leadership reshapes across them to align capability, ability, and capacity at scale.

---
## Abstract

This article formalizes a six-stage framework of organizational development—Stage 0 (“Zero-to-One”) through Stage 5 (“Adaptive Renewal/Excellence”)—drawn from and aligned with the Canonical Concepts & Constructs and the General Glossary of Terms. The stages describe a migration of the locus of capability from individuals to institutions and the corresponding evolution of leadership practice through the **DOES** cycle (Design, Organize, Execute, Sustain). I integrate adjacent research—including Greiner’s phases and crises, Churchill & Lewis’s small-business stages, Adizes’s corporate lifecycle, and dynamic-capabilities theory—to justify stage transitions and failure modes. The paper distinguishes **capability** from **ability** and **capacity** and clarifies the dependency of **individual capacity** on **organizational capability** and structures. The result is a conceptual foundation for stage-specific diagnostics, leadership development, and operating-model design that can be tested empirically and operationalized in practice. 

---
## Introduction

Organizations do not merely grow; they **change form**. Across their journey, they repeatedly encounter thresholds where the prior coordinating mechanism becomes a constraint, triggering a qualitative shift in structure, leadership, and learning. The **Organizational Stages** in the canonical glossary define this developmental trajectory from inception to adaptive maturity and supply the vocabulary used here for definitional precision and systemic alignment.  

This paper has three aims. First, to **anchor the six stages** (Stage 0 plus Stages 1–5) in canonical definition and purpose. Second, to integrate **individual capability** and **organizational capability**—and their relationship to **ability** and **capacity**—as the underlying developmental logic. Third, to show how the **DOES Leadership Model** shifts emphasis across stages, converting strategy into structure, structure into execution, and execution into renewal.  

---

## Foundations: Capability, Ability, and Capacity

### Capability and Ability

**Capability** denotes the capacity to handle increasing complexity across time horizons—how individuals and organizations **anticipate, decide, and adapt**—distinct from **ability**, which is present-tense, skill-based know-how applied within known conditions.   

At the **individual** level, capability reflects judgment and sense-making under ambiguity; it is shaped by experience and governs potential for higher levels of work. At the **organizational** level, capability is the system’s resilience—its governance, processes, and culture that enable coherent sense- and meaning-making beyond any single person. 
### Capacity and Its Dependency

**Capacity** concerns **scale, scope, and volume**—how broadly ability and capability can be applied across teams and timeframes. Critically, **individual capacity** is **relational**: it cannot be sustained without the scaffolding of **organizational capacity** (resources, roles, cadence, tooling). Thus, even extraordinary individuals cannot sustain high throughput in the absence of enabling structures; conversely, robust systems can multiply average individual performance.  
### Cognitive Underpinning

The developmental link between people and structure is illuminated by **Stratified Systems Theory** and Gillian Stamp’s **Mode of Thinking**, which align individual potential capability with levels of work and time span. This alignment explains why mis-matches (e.g., complex roles staffed with purely serial thinkers) degrade execution and learning.

## The Six Organizational Stages

### Stage 0 — Zero-to-One (Visionary Genesis)

#### Definition and Purpose
Stage 0 is the leap from non-existence to **novel value**: the founder articulates a contrarian thesis, discovers problem–solution fit, and produces a first instantiation of something meaningfully **new** rather than incrementally better. Canonically, creation begins with belief and drive before formal systems exist. 
#### Justification and Adjacent Scholarship
Thiel’s “Zero to One” sharpens the distinction between **vertical progress** (0→1 novelty) and **horizontal progress** (1→n replication), clarifying why Stage 0 is categorically different from scaling stages.  
#### Capability, Ability, and Capacity
Capability is intensely **individual**; ability is artisanal craft and hustle; capacity is limited by cash and founder bandwidth. Without rudimentary organizational capability, **individual capacity** will exhaust quickly—highlighting early needs for cadence and minimal structure.  
#### DOES Emphasis
**Design** dominates (hypothesis generation, framing), **Execute** is hands-on, **Organize** is intentionally light, and **Sustain** focuses on resilience habits and cash discipline.  

---
### Stage 1 — Early Framework

#### Definition and Purpose
Basic roles and processes appear; personal effort becomes an initial organizational form. The locus of capability remains with the founder, but **repeatability** emerges.  
#### Justification and Adjacent Scholarship
Greiner’s early “creativity” phase ends in a **crisis of leadership**, where a single overseer can no longer coordinate everything—propelling the shift toward direction and basic management.  
#### Capability, Ability, and Capacity
Individual capability is still the primary driver; **organizational capability** appears as simple routines and metrics. Individual capacity expands only as organizational capacity (people, rhythm, tooling) grows.  
#### DOES Emphasis
**Execute** and **Design** remain prominent; **Organize** introduces clarity of roles and basic cadence; **Sustain** is reactive but intentional (after-action reviews, founder self-care).  

---
### Stage 2 — Growth Acceleration

#### Definition and Purpose
Demand outpaces structure; coordination becomes the constraint. Stronger prioritization and formalization are required to **sustain** growth. 
#### Justification and Adjacent Scholarship
Churchill & Lewis’s model shows the owner’s role shifting from doer to **manager**, while Greiner predicts a crisis of direction giving way to **delegation** and planning. 
#### Capability, Ability, and Capacity
**Organizational capability** begins to **substitute** for individual heroics via SOPs and basic governance. This substitution is multiplicative: it raises **organizational capacity**, allowing more work at higher reliability with the same talent.
#### DOES Emphasis
**Organize** rises (resource management, talent alignment, communication), **Execute** becomes process-based, **Design** shifts to roadmaps, and **Sustain** formalizes reviews and compliance.  

---
### Stage 3 — Operational Maturity

#### Definition and Purpose
Execution stabilizes; management layers, accountability, and empowered teams replace heroics with **reliable, repeatable performance**. 
#### Justification and Adjacent Scholarship
Greiner anticipates a **crisis of coordination** as silos form; the remedy is integrative mechanisms and planning disciplines that align end-to-end value streams.
#### Capability, Ability, and Capacity
Organizational capability—now embodied in cross-functional governance and shared methods—drives throughput. Individual capacity expands through **system fluency** more than raw skill, as roles require navigation across interdependencies. 
#### DOES Emphasis
**Design** becomes system design (operating models), **Organize** orchestrates cross-functional work, **Execute** emphasizes cycle time and quality, **Sustain** institutionalizes continuous improvement and knowledge management. 

---
### Stage 4 — Strategic Coherence

#### Definition and Purpose
Leadership aligns **vision, systems, and accountability**; strategy integrates foresight, ethics, and risk into a coherent direction across portfolios, geographies, or platforms.  
#### Justification and Adjacent Scholarship
**Dynamic-capabilities** research explains performance advantages where firms can **sense**, **seize**, and **reconfigure**—organizational capabilities that must be embedded beyond any individual. 
#### Capability, Ability, and Capacity
Enterprise capability becomes the **dominant** performance driver; individual capacity scales through roles that allocate resources, orchestrate talent markets, and shape culture. This is where **organizational capacity** (scope, scale, volume) most visibly multiplies outcomes.  
#### DOES Emphasis
**Design** becomes strategy-as-learning; **Organize** links strategy to resource orchestration and culture building; **Execute** balances scale efficiency with local responsiveness; **Sustain** emphasizes resilience, risk ethics, and leadership pipelines. 

---

### Stage 5 — Adaptive Renewal (Institutionalized Excellence)

#### Definition and Purpose
Learning and agility define success; the organization continually **evolves**, balancing stability with innovation to sustain long-term relevance and performance. 
#### Justification and Adjacent Scholarship
Adizes warns of the slide from **Prime** into bureaucratic decline; sustained excellence requires renewal systems that protect identity while refreshing strategy and design. **Dynamic-capabilities** again provide the microfoundations for persistent advantage.  
#### Capability, Ability, and Capacity
Capability is now **institutional**: values, culture, governance, and routines carry adaptation forward. Individual capacity expresses through stewardship—shaping future conditions, not merely operating within present ones.  
#### DOES Emphasis
**Sustain** becomes generative (foresight, innovation leadership, resilience, change, sustainability), while **Design** curates long-horizon bets, **Organize** keeps the architecture adaptive, and **Execute** remains world-class through continuous learning.  [oai_citation:47‡General Glossary of Terms.md](file-service://file-1AciCHYJWyUWWFDwBxeYja)

## Justifying Stage Boundaries with Adjacent Scholarship

### Evolution–Revolution Dynamics
Greiner’s cross-industry synthesis demonstrates that growth proceeds through **evolutionary periods** punctuated by predictable **crises** (leadership, autonomy/direction, coordination, bureaucracy), each requiring a new managerial logic. This empirical pattern undergirds the step-changes described in Stages 1–5.  
### Small-Business Progression and the Owner’s Role
Churchill & Lewis show how the owner’s role evolves from hands-on operator to strategic manager, mirroring the migration of capability from person to system central to Stage 1→3 transitions.  
### Liecycle Risks and Renewal
Adizes’s lifecycle identifies **Prime** as the delicate balance of flexibility and control; without explicit renewal (Stage 5), organizations drift into aristocracy and decline—clarifying the necessity of **Sustain** at advanced stages. 
### Microfoundations of Renewal
Dynamic-capabilities theory provides the **how** of Stage 4–5: firms outperform when they routinize **sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring** amid change—capabilities that are, by design, **organizational**, not merely individual.
### The Uniqueness of Stage 0
“Zero-to-One” clarifies that Stage 0 pursues vertical progress—non-incremental novelty—requiring Design-heavy leadership and minimal structure until repeatability emerges. 

---

## How DOES Leadership Evolves by Stage

### Rebalancing the Cycle

The **DOES Leadership Model** is universal—expressed at every level and horizon—but its **relative emphasis** shifts with stage complexity. In early stages, Design and Execute dominate; mid-stages elevate Organize to convert ingenuity into throughput; advanced stages privilege Sustain to embed renewal, ethics, and resilience. 
### Stage-Specific Expressions

#### Stage 0–1
Design frames contrarian theses and product learning; Execute is founder-led craft; Organize installs only the lightest scaffolding; Sustain preserves founder energy and cash runway.  
#### Stage 2
Organize formalizes roles, budgets, and cross-functional collaboration so that ability scales; Sustain adds governance cadence; Design becomes roadmap-driven. 
#### Stage 3
Design operates at system level; Organize coordinates across functions; Execute targets reliability and cycle time; Sustain institutionalizes continuous improvement and knowledge systems. 
#### Stage 4–5
Design becomes strategy-as-learning and optioncraft; Organize orchestrates portfolios and culture; Execute balances scale with local context; Sustain stewards identity, resilience, leadership development, change, and sustainability thinking.

## Implications and Propositions for Further Work

### Diagnostic Implications
Stage diagnosis should assess the **dominant constraint** (e.g., coordination vs. agility), the **current DOES balance**, and the **capability mix** (individual vs. organizational). Canonical definitions make this assessment coherent across engagements.
### Propositions

#### P1 — Crisis-Capability Fit
Organizations advance stages when the prevailing coordinating mechanism fails to resolve the core constraint, necessitating a different DOES balance; this is consistent with Greiner’s evolution–revolution dynamic. 
#### P2 — Embedding Gradient
From Stage 2 onward, the share of performance variance explained by **organizational capability** increases monotonically; by Stage 5, dynamic capabilities are primarily institutional. 
#### P3 — Capacity Is Relational
**Individual capacity** cannot be sustained without **organizational capacity**; measured improvements in throughput under constant headcount should track investments in structure, cadence, and tooling. 
#### P4 — Cognitive–Role Alignment
Alignment between **Mode of Thinking** (potential capability) and **Level of Work** predicts performance at stage transitions; mis-matches degrade quality and increase cycle time.  
#### P5 — Stewardship as a Safeguard
Without **Sustain** disciplines, organizations at Stage 4 will drift; stewardship practices preserve identity while enabling renewal. 

---

## Conclusion

Progress from Zero-to-One to Adaptive Excellence is not a straight line of scale; it is a **sequence of form changes**. Each stage reassigns the work of leadership across DOES, gradually relocating capability from exceptional people to resilient systems. Distinguishing capability, ability, and capacity—and recognizing the dependency of individual capacity on organizational capability—equips leaders to design the **next form** before crisis compels it. This staged lens provides a researchable map for diagnostics, development, and operating-model design across the Management Horizon.

## Organization’s Core Functions

[Knowledge Base](https://josejruiz.com/knowledge-base/) > [Organizational Design and Development](https://josejruiz.com/organizational-design-and-development/)

# Core Organizational Functions as an Operating System

## Excerpt
High-performing enterprises align how well they **navigate complexity** with how much they can **deliver**. This article reframes twelve **Core Organizational Functions** as one horizon-spanning operating system—where judgment, coordination, and learning grow in step with scale, throughput, and reach.

## Abstract
Organizations succeed when they treat **Capability** and **Capacity** as twin forces in one design—then make both legible across time horizons.

- **Capability** is the power to navigate complexity through judgment, sense-making, and meaning-making across time horizons—sustaining coherence, direction, and resilience over time.
- **Capacity** is the scope, reach, and scale over which Ability and Capability can be applied while preserving coherence.
- **Ability** is the demonstrated proficiency to perform specific work in a given context, at a given time.

The twelve **Core Organizational Functions** are horizon-spanning commitments—each expressed across the **Present, Future, and Enduring** horizons—and each evaluated through **Ability, Organizational Capability, and Capacity**. They are not departments or org-chart boxes; they are enduring systems of work through which the organization converts intent into outcomes, adapts under uncertainty, and sustains coherence as it scales.

The twelve Core Organizational Functions are: Customer Experience and Relationship Management; Sales and Marketing Operations; Product and Service Development; Operations and Supply Chain Management; Infrastructure and Technology Operations; Financial and Resource Management; Human Capital Management; Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC); Strategic Planning and Business Management; Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility; Leadership and Executive Management; and Board and Governance Stewardship.

## Introduction
Every strategy is a promise to convert intention into outcomes under uncertainty. Two questions determine whether the promise holds:

1) *Can we make sound decisions as complexity rises?*
2) *Can we deliver at the volume and speed the market demands?*

These questions are inseparable. Sophisticated choices without enough bandwidth stall execution; abundant resources without sound judgment multiplies rework.

This is why the Core Organizational Functions matter. Each function is an enduring system of work that must hold across three horizons:

- **Present:** today’s execution, reliability, and throughput
- **Future:** building what must be true next—platforms, talent, options, and readiness
- **Enduring:** protecting the mandate, identity, and long-run legitimacy that keeps the enterprise coherent over time

And each function can be examined through three lenses:

- **Ability:** do we reliably perform the concrete work required here, in the current context?
- **Organizational Capability:** do decision rights, structures, and culture convert diverse perspectives into shared sense and coordinated action over time?
- **Capacity:** can we apply Ability and Capability across sufficient scope, reach, and scale without losing coherence?

The operating-system metaphor is deliberate: the functions are not “parts” competing for priority. They are interlocking commitments. Weakness in one becomes friction, risk, or rework in another—especially under growth.

## How to use this article
For any function below, ask three horizon questions:

- **Present:** What must run reliably now? What breaks when volume spikes?
- **Future:** What must we build, standardize, or learn to handle the next level of complexity?
- **Enduring:** What must remain coherent and legitimate for the organization to keep its license to operate?

Then assess with the three lenses:

- **Ability:** task performance and execution quality
- **Organizational Capability:** coherence under complexity
- **Capacity:** scalable reach without degradation

What follows describes each function as a system of work expressed across those horizons.

---

## 1) Customer Experience and Relationship Management
**Present:** CX is execution under attention. Teams sense customer need, remove friction, and deliver consistent service levels across channels. Ability shows up in response quality, resolution discipline, and a service posture that customers recognize as dependable.

**Future:** The system must learn. Research, analytics, voice-of-customer, journey instrumentation, and service design turn interaction volume into insight. The enterprise builds repeatable playbooks—what to standardize, what to personalize, and how to improve without breaking service.

**Enduring:** Trust becomes a strategic asset. The organization protects relationships through fairness, transparency, and continuity—especially when policies change, products evolve, or markets tighten.

**Organizational Capability and Capacity:** As complexity rises, CX requires coherent decision rights (what can be resolved where), shared meaning about “good service,” and Capacity through staffing, automation paths, knowledge systems, and coverage models that scale without hollowing out empathy.

---

## 2) Sales and Marketing Operations
**Present:** Commercial performance depends on translating market signal into repeatable motion. Ability shows in segmentation, messaging clarity, qualification discipline, and reliable handoffs.

**Future:** The system builds optionality: new routes-to-market, improved pricing logic, better attribution, and experimentation that does not overwhelm the funnel. Forecasting improves when definitions are stable and feedback is fast.

**Enduring:** The enterprise protects credibility. Overpromising, discount addiction, or incoherent narratives degrade the brand’s long-run bargaining power and legitimacy.

**Organizational Capability and Capacity:** The commercial engine scales through shared definitions (stages, qualification, handoffs), coherent incentives, and platforms that increase reach without breaking integrity—so the organization can pursue more opportunity safely.

---

## 3) Product and Service Development
**Present:** Product work is judgment under uncertainty. Teams decide what to build, what to stop, and how to stage risk. Ability shows in discovery quality, delivery discipline, and learning speed.

**Future:** The system expands its learning loops: testing environments, release automation, observability, portfolio governance, and cross-functional integration that reduces late rework. More concurrent streams should increase insight—not chaos.

**Enduring:** The organization sustains identity through its product principles, quality standards, and the coherence of its promises to the market.

**Organizational Capability and Capacity:** Capacity growth (more teams, more releases, more customers) must be matched with Organizational Capability: clear decision rights, consistent product language, and coherent trade-off forums that keep the portfolio legible as complexity rises.

---

## 4) Operations and Supply Chain Management
**Present:** Operations turn demand into reliable delivery. Ability shows in planning execution, quality discipline, and control of flow—production rates, inventory accuracy, lane performance, and contingency management.

**Future:** The system develops resilience: scenario planning, supplier strategy, modular standards, and network adaptability so localized peaks don’t become systemic congestion.

**Enduring:** The enterprise protects reliability as part of its identity—what customers can count on even when volatility spikes (geopolitical shocks, supplier fragility, seasonal swings).

**Organizational Capability and Capacity:** Scaling operations is not just more assets—it’s coherence: shared standards, integrated S&OP logic, and decision rights that keep the system stable as volume and variability increase.

---

## 5) Infrastructure and Technology Operations
**Present:** Technology is backbone and accelerator. Ability shows in uptime, incident response, service management, and security hygiene.

**Future:** The system reduces accidental complexity: architecture coherence, observability, change management, and platform choices that keep future work easier—not harder. Elasticity and reliability scale together.

**Enduring:** The enterprise protects integrity: cybersecurity posture, data stewardship, and architectural legibility that preserve trust and institutional safety.

**Organizational Capability and Capacity:** Capacity is compute, coverage, concurrency, and support reach. Organizational Capability is the governance and shared discipline that keeps added horsepower controllable.

---

## 6) Financial and Resource Management
**Present:** Finance turns ambiguity into actionable constraint. Ability shows in close quality, transaction accuracy, variance clarity, and controls that work without stalling operations.

**Future:** The system expands forecasting intelligence: scenario analysis, unit economics, capital allocation logic, and decision support that helps leaders steer under uncertainty.

**Enduring:** The organization sustains legitimacy through stewardship—trustworthy reporting, sound governance, and a financial narrative that remains coherent over time.

**Organizational Capability and Capacity:** Capacity is reporting scale and analytical throughput. Organizational Capability is making numbers meaningful—shared definitions, consistent decision forums, and cultural discipline that prevents “competing truths.”

---

## 7) Human Capital Management
**Present:** People systems define how talent moves, grows, and performs. Ability shows in hiring quality, onboarding reliability, performance calibration, and role clarity.

**Future:** The system builds readiness: leadership development, learning environments that shorten time-to-proficiency, workforce planning, and mobility mechanisms that reallocate Capacity where it’s needed without breaking coherence.

**Enduring:** The enterprise protects culture as an operating asset—norms that sustain fairness, dignity, and trust across growth, change, and constraint.

**Organizational Capability and Capacity:** Scaling people systems requires coherent standards (what “good” looks like), decision rights for performance, and Capacity in pipelines and manager bandwidth—so growth deepens judgment rather than diluting it.

---

## 8) Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)
**Present:** GRC works best as enablement. Ability shows in proportionate controls, clear accountability, training execution, and monitoring that detects issues early.

**Future:** The system embeds governance into workflows: policy-as-code where appropriate, automation, and risk intelligence that keeps speed safe as partnerships and products multiply.

**Enduring:** The organization protects its mandate and license to operate—ethics, compliance posture, and the institutional trust that prevents governance failures from becoming existential.

**Organizational Capability and Capacity:** Capacity is audit reach and monitoring cadence. Organizational Capability is the shared discipline that keeps guardrails legible—and exceptions rare.

---

## 9) Strategic Planning and Business Management
**Present:** Strategy is selection; business management is synchronization. Ability shows in planning clarity, prioritization, portfolio visibility, and execution cadence (reviews, OKRs, program oversight).

**Future:** The system strengthens sensing: competitive intelligence, analytics platforms, and decision architecture that adapts as the environment shifts—without destabilizing execution.

**Enduring:** The enterprise sustains direction: a coherent identity, a stable strategic logic, and a long-run narrative that holds even as initiatives change.

**Organizational Capability and Capacity:** Capacity is how many initiatives can run concurrently without fragmentation. Organizational Capability is the coherence that prevents “more work” from becoming “less meaning.”

---

## 10) Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility
**Present:** Sustainability becomes real as operational practice. Ability shows in baseline measurement, compliance execution, and reduction initiatives that stick.

**Future:** The system builds durable mechanisms: data pipelines, supplier standards, materiality assessment, and investment logic that turns aspiration into measurable outcomes.

**Enduring:** The organization protects legitimacy: stewardship that aligns with stakeholder expectations and strengthens trust over time.

**Organizational Capability and Capacity:** Capacity is reporting reach across sites and regions. Organizational Capability is aligning diverse interests into coordinated action without turning sustainability into performative theater.

---

## 11) Leadership and Executive Management
**Present:** Executives integrate tensions: today vs tomorrow, efficiency vs adaptability, global vs local. Ability shows in prioritization, follow-through, and decision velocity without thrash.

**Future:** The system designs learning and succession: scalable forums, clear escalation paths, leadership development, and mechanisms that make decision-making repeatable.

**Enduring:** The enterprise sustains coherence through narrative clarity and stable intent—so the organization remains aligned even as leaders change.

**Organizational Capability and Capacity:** Capacity is leadership bandwidth and governance cadence. Organizational Capability is the coherence that makes decisions “made once, understood everywhere.”

---

## 12) Board and Governance Stewardship
**Present:** Boards clarify mandate, define success, and oversee risk without drifting into management. Ability shows in committee effectiveness, information quality, and decision discipline.

**Future:** The system strengthens foresight: expertise diversification, dashboards that reveal weak signals, and governance interfaces that surface trade-offs early.

**Enduring:** The board protects institutional continuity—license, legitimacy, and stewardship of identity across generations of leadership.

**Organizational Capability and Capacity:** Capacity is oversight reach and cadence. Organizational Capability is the coherence of governance—shared standards for what matters, and disciplined attention to the right risks across horizons.

---

## Conclusion
The twelve **Core Organizational Functions** are not departments. They are **horizon-spanning commitments**—enduring systems of work through which the organization converts intent into outcomes, adapts under uncertainty, and sustains coherence as it scales.

Capability without Capacity leaves talent stranded. Capacity without Capability accelerates error. The practical move is to assess each function across **Present, Future, and Enduring** horizons—then evaluate through **Ability, Organizational Capability, and Capacity**. Done well, the enterprise becomes an operating system that learns faster as it scales—and scales faster because it learns.

## Excerpt
This concept paper reframes position descriptions as core design artifacts in the architecture of work. It anchors every role in Management Horizons, Domains of Competence, the Triad of Direction, DOES leadership, and Organizational Stages. It shows how to specify context, horizon, and decision rights, clarify borders of delegation and escalation, and define the transformation path from current state to desired future so roles become engines of coherent strategy execution and renewal across teams and context.

## 1. Purpose of This Concept Paper

This paper defines what a position description must contain when it is treated as a design artifact in the Architecture of Work, not just a transactional job posting. It anchors position descriptions in:

- **Domains of Competence**: capability, ability, and capacity  
- **Management Horizons**, Levels of Work, and Contribution Bands™  
- **Organizational Stages**  
- **Triad of Direction**: management, leadership, stewardship  
- **DOES leadership model**: Design, Organize, Execute, Sustain  
- **Borders of delegation and escalation** within a clear space of autonomy  

The intent is to provide a reusable guide so that every position description explicitly expresses three things:

1. The **current situation and challenge** in context  
2. The **desired future contribution** of the role  
3. The **transformation path** the role must help design, organize, execute, and sustain  

---

## 2. Position Descriptions Inside the Architecture of Work

In the Architecture of Work, borders of delegation, escalation, and autonomy are designed so complexity, control, and judgment are distributed coherently across the organization. It clarifies who holds which decisions, with what authorization, so work remains safe, stretching, and coherent across levels and horizons.

Within that architecture, a **position description** is not only a list of tasks. It is:

- A **mandate**: the value-creating promise of the role in the value chain  
- A **horizon specification**: the time span and complexity of decisions the role must hold  
- A **directional contract**: how the role will practice management, leadership, and stewardship  
- A **decision charter**: which decisions are owned, delegated, or escalated and on what thresholds  
- A **transformation brief**: how the role contributes to moving from current state to desired future  

Done well, position descriptions become a primary way to align individual capability, organizational capability, and institutional capability with real context.

## 3. Domains of Competence in a Position Description

The Domains of Competence distinguish three different ideas that are often conflated:

- **Ability** – practical skill and know-how to perform tasks effectively now; applied knowledge, skills, and experience  
- **Capability** – the power to handle complexity through judgment and sense-making across time horizons  
- **Capacity** – the volume, scale, and scope with which ability and capability can be applied across teams, systems, and timeframes  

A complete position description makes each visible:

1. **Required abilities**  
   - Concrete skills and know-how needed now (e.g., “design and run value-stream pilots”, “negotiate multi-year customer contracts”)  
   - Evidence types: portfolio, certifications, performance history  

2. **Required capability (complexity and time span)**  
   - The **Level of Work** (e.g., Quality, Service, Practice) and associated time span and problem structure  
   - The **Contribution Band / Management Horizon** at which the role must reliably contribute (Present, Future, Enduring)  

3. **Required capacity and scale**  
   - Scale of budget, customers, and ecosystems the role must carry  
   - Breadth of interfaces (number of teams, geographies, partners)  

In practice, this means the position description must distinguish between:

- “Can code in Python” (ability)  
- “Can frame and decide multi-year platform choices under uncertainty” (capability)  
- “Can carry a portfolio of four platforms across three regions” (capacity / scale)  

---

## 4. Management Horizon, Levels of Work, Contribution Bands™, and Organizational Stages

### 4.1 Management Horizon and Contribution Bands™

Management Horizons distinguish three overlapping temporal lenses:

- **Present Horizon**  
- **Future Horizon**  
- **Enduring Horizon**  

The Contribution Bands™ framework locates a person’s flow of contribution across these horizons (illustrative mapping):

- **Bands One–Two**: execution and mastery in the **Present** (≈0–12 months)  
- **Band Three**: bridge between **Present and Future**, converting proof into scalable practice (≈6–24 months)  
- **Band Four**: architecture of the **Future**, designing platforms and operating models (≈1–3 years)  
- **Band Five**: bridge between **Future and Enduring**, shaping portfolios, arenas, and advantage logic (≈2–5 years)  
- **Band Six**: **Enduring** stewardship of identity, license, and cross-generational commitments (≈5–10+ years)  

A position description should therefore make explicit:

- **Primary Management Horizon**: Present, Future, or Enduring  
- **Contribution Band and Level of Work**: where the core contribution sits and the associated time span  
- Whether the role is a **bridge role** (Band Three or Five) and which horizon it faces most  

This connects directly to four archetypal roles:

- **Works within the strategy** – Present-horizon roles (Bands One–Two, sometimes Three-Present-facing)  
- **Deploys the strategy** – Bridge and architecture roles (Band Three-Future-facing, Band Four)  
- **Defines the strategy** – Compass roles (Band Five-Future-facing, sometimes Band Four at enterprise scale)  
- **Defines the governance mandate** – Continuum roles in the Enduring horizon (Band Six and Band Five-Enduring-facing)  

### 4.2 Organizational Stages

Organizational Stages describe how capability and complexity evolve from early formation through institutionalization. In early stages, complexity is held in a founder’s head; in later stages, it is held in structures, governance, and culture.

A position description should specify:

- The **dominant Organizational Stage** of the unit (e.g., Stage One “Early Framework” in a start-up product line; Stage Three or Four in a mature core business)  
- How the role must adapt its practice of management, leadership, and stewardship to that stage (for example, more improvisation and design in Stage One; more governance and stewardship in Stage Four)  

This anchors the **context and challenge** the role is walking into rather than describing work as if it lived in a vacuum.

## 5. Triad of Direction, Space of Autonomy, and Borders of Delegation and Escalation

### 5.1 Triad of Direction in a Role

The **Triad of Direction** distinguishes three directional disciplines present in every role:

- **Management** – organizing work, coordinating resources, and ensuring reliable execution in known systems  
- **Leadership** – creating direction, fostering alignment, and sustaining commitment amid complexity  
- **Stewardship** – guiding, protecting, and advancing something of value beyond self and across time (identity, ethics, license to operate)  

Every position description should articulate how the role is expected to express all three, scaled to its horizon:

- In **Present-horizon** roles, management will dominate but leadership (improvement, small bets) and stewardship (safety, ethics, reputation) still matter  
- In **Future-horizon** roles, leadership is heavier: framing bets, sequencing programs, mobilizing adoption; stewardship appears as principled constraints on change  
- In **Enduring-horizon** roles, stewardship is primary; management and leadership are instruments for protecting and renewing institutional identity and legitimacy  

### 5.2 Space of Autonomy

Each role operates within a **space of autonomy**: a bounded area of responsibility in the value chain where the person is expected to act without seeking permission, provided they remain within agreed constraints.

The position description should make that space explicit by:

- Describing the **scope of responsibility** (products, services, domains, geographies, or processes)  
- Using a **SIPOC-style boundary** where helpful (Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers) to clarify what the role promises and to whom  
- Stating the **dominant Management Horizon and Level of Work** for that scope  

Within this space of autonomy, the person’s freedom to act is conditioned by:

- Alignment with strategy and governance mandates  
- Adherence to standards and risk limits  
- The borders of delegation and escalation described next  

### 5.3 Borders of Delegation and Escalation

Two key borders shape decision flow:

- **Border of Delegation** – outer limit of what can be passed downward while the role holder remains accountable  
- **Border of Escalation** – point at which work must be handed upward because authority, risk, or horizon exceed the remit  

For each position, the description should translate this into practice:

- **Decisions the role must own** (inside its border of escalation)  
- **Decisions the role must delegate and to whom** (inside its border of delegation)  
- **Thresholds for escalation** – typically expressed in terms of time horizon, risk, capital, or reputation exposure  
- The expected **escalation posture** – when to consult, when to inform, when to seek formal approval  

This makes the space of autonomy inspectable and auditable rather than tacit.

---

## 6. DOES Leadership Model and Transformation Requirements

The **DOES Leadership Model** connects vision to structure, structure to action, and action to renewal through four activities:

- **Design** – shaping intent, frames, and architectures  
- **Organize** – aligning people, interfaces, processes, and resources  
- **Execute** – delivering outcomes, decisions, and learning in real work  
- **Sustain** – tending to renewal: capability, culture, and guardrails over time  

A transformation-aware position description makes explicit:

- **Design accountabilities** – how the role shapes intent, reframes problems, and contributes to strategy and operating-model design  
- **Organize accountabilities** – how the role aligns people, interfaces, processes, and resources to make intent operable  
- **Execute accountabilities** – how the role is accountable for delivery, learning, and decision quality within its space of autonomy  
- **Sustain accountabilities** – how the role tends to renewal: capability building, succession, retrospectives, and adjustment of guardrails  

DOES must be calibrated to the horizon and Organizational Stage:

- In a **Stage One** unit, a “within strategy” role may still carry heavy **Design and Organize** work because the basic framework is being built  
- In a **Stage Four** unit, a “deploy strategy” role may be more weighted to **Execute and Sustain**, working within well-established architectures  

To meet the requirement that the position address **current situation, desired future, and transformation path**, the description should include:

1. **Current context** – stage, horizon, and dominant problems  
2. **Desired future state** of the domain – clearer flow, different portfolio, renewed license  
3. **Transformation work** expected of the role along DOES – what must be designed, organized, executed differently, and sustained  

---

## 7. Core Elements of a Position Description in the Anker Bioss Framework

Bringing the pieces together, a complete position description should include at least the following elements:

1. **Role Purpose and Value-Creating Promise**  
   - One concise statement of what the role exists to make possible in the value chain  

2. **Context and Organizational Stage**  
   - Description of the unit’s dominant Organizational Stage and current pressures (e.g., scaling from Stage One to Stage Two; renewing a Stage Four core)  

3. **Management Horizon, Contribution Band™, and Level of Work**  
   - Primary horizon (Present / Future / Enduring)  
   - Expected time span of discretion  
   - Target Contribution Band / Level of Work  

4. **Domains of Competence**  
   - Required **abilities** (skills and know-how)  
   - Required **capability** (complexity and time-span judgment)  
   - Required **capacity** (scale and scope)  

5. **Scope of Responsibility and SIPOC Boundary**  
   - The product, service, process, or geographic domains where the role operates  
   - External promises (suppliers, inputs, outputs, customers)  
   - Dominant Management Horizon and Level of Work for that scope  

6. **Triad of Direction Expectations**  
   - How this role is expected to practice management, leadership, and stewardship at its horizon  

7. **Decision Rights and Borders of Delegation / Escalation**  
   - Decision map (or reference to a separate charter) that names:  
     - Owned decisions  
     - Delegable decisions (and to whom)  
     - Escalation triggers and thresholds  

8. **DOES and Transformation Responsibilities**  
   - Specific **Design, Organize, Execute, and Sustain** outputs linked to the current-to-future transformation path  

9. **Key Interfaces and Relationships**  
   - Internal and external counterparts, especially across horizons (e.g., Band Three working with Band Two below and Band Four above)  

10. **Signals and Measures**  
    - Present, Future, and Enduring indicators where relevant  
    - Leading and lagging measures tied to the role’s value-creating promise  

11. **Stretch, Risk, and Development**  
    - Whether the role is a stretch relative to the current Flow Band  
    - Scaffolds, review cadence, and risk boundaries if the role is used developmentally  

---

## 8. Differentiating Four Archetypal Positions

The same structure can describe the four archetypal positions highlighted earlier. For each, the position description emphasizes different horizons and parts of the Triad of Direction and DOES:

### 8.1 Works Within the Strategy (Operational Roles)

- **Horizon**: Present; Bands One–Two (sometimes Three-Present-facing)  
- **Triad emphasis**:  
  - Management in daily delivery and stability  
  - Leadership in continuous improvement and problem-solving  
  - Stewardship in safety, ethics, and local reputation  
- **DOES emphasis**:  
  - Execute and Sustain  
  - Some Organize as methods mature  
- **Borders**:  
  - Tight escalation on capital and risk  
  - Broad autonomy on local methods within standards  

### 8.2 Deploys the Strategy (Scaling / Architecture Roles)

- **Horizon**: bridge Present↔Future and Future; Bands Three and Four  
- **Triad emphasis**:  
  - Leadership in experiment selection, adoption, and sequencing  
  - Stewardship in maintaining coherence across value streams and geographies  
- **DOES emphasis**:  
  - Design and Organize (platforms, programs, operating models)  
  - Execute for pilots and early runs  
  - Sustain through hand-off to stable operations  
- **Borders**:  
  - Owns known/controlled and unknown/controlled quadrants for their platforms  
  - Escalates unknown/uncontrolled bets or shifts with major license implications  

### 8.3 Defines the Strategy (Compass Roles)

- **Horizon**: Future; Band Five-Future-facing (sometimes Band Four at lower scale)  
- **Triad emphasis**:  
  - Leadership in pattern recognition, choice of arenas, and framing of big bets  
  - Stewardship in aligning direction with identity, obligations, and license  
- **DOES emphasis**:  
  - Design of strategy, portfolios, and strategic architectures  
  - Organize in the form of program architecture, decision cadences, and resource envelopes  
  - Execute mainly through governing decisions, not day-to-day operations  
  - Sustain through periodic strategic renewal and reframing  

### 8.4 Defines the Governance Mandate (Stewardship Roles)

- **Horizon**: Enduring; Band Six and Band Five-Enduring-facing  
- **Triad emphasis**:  
  - Stewardship as primary  
  - Leadership and management in service of license, ethics, and cross-generational coherence  
- **DOES emphasis**:  
  - Sustain institutions, covenants, and resilience platforms  
  - Design guardrails, constitutional principles, and enduring commitments  
  - Organize governance forums and oversight mechanisms  
  - Execute only at the level of critical constitutional or “never-fail” decisions  

Position descriptions should make these differences explicit, not leave them to title or personality.

---

## 9. Risks and Watchouts

Predictable failure modes appear when position descriptions are not grounded in this architecture:

- **Conflating ability with capability** – promoting strong operators into longer-horizon roles without evidence of judgment under higher complexity  
- **Ignoring Organizational Stage** – writing a Stage Four governance description for a Stage One start-up unit, or vice versa  
- **Triad / Tripod confusion** – treating management, leadership, and stewardship as levels rather than disciplines present in every role; or confusing the Triad with the Tripod of Work that governs daily practice within an area of responsibility  
- **Invisible borders of delegation and escalation** – leaving decision rights implicit, which undermines autonomy and overloads higher levels  
- **No transformation path** – describing only “business as usual” when the context clearly demands Design and Sustain work across horizons  

Each of these can be mitigated when the position description is treated as part of the Architecture of Work rather than as HR paperwork.

---

## 10. Practical Next Steps

For an organization adopting this approach, the following pattern helps:

1. **Place the Work**  
   - For each critical role, declare the Management Horizon, Contribution Band™, Level of Work, and Organizational Stage context  

2. **Place the Person**  
   - Use assessment, evaluation, and appreciation disciplines to understand current ability, emerging capability, and Flow Band, without collapsing them into a single score  

3. **Author Position Descriptions as Decision Charters**  
   - Add Triad of Direction expectations, explicit space of autonomy, and decision rights (borders of delegation and escalation) to the traditional content  

4. **Link to DOES and Transformation Programs**  
   - For roles central to transformation, specify **Design, Organize, Execute, and Sustain** accountabilities explicitly and connect them to named programs or change agendas  

5. **Review and Renew**  
   - At defined horizons (e.g., annually for Present-horizon roles, every 2–3 years for Future-horizon roles), revisit position descriptions as living instruments, not static documents  

When position descriptions are built this way, they become one of the primary tools for aligning individual work with Management Horizons, distributing judgment safely through clear borders, and turning transformation from rhetoric into designed roles and accountabilities.

## Responsibility vs. Accountability in Tasking

[Knowledge Base](https://josejruiz.com/knowledge-base/) > [Organizational Design and Development](https://josejruiz.com/organizational-design-and-development/)

By Jose J. Ruiz

---
## Excerpt
Tasking gives the doer real discretion to deliver within explicit boundaries; accountability stays with the manager-of-work to ensure the surrounding system is coherent, safe, and auditable. That separation enables principled speed—autonomy without abandonment, oversight without crowding.

## Abstract
Organizations often confuse responsibility and accountability, especially in fast-moving environments where tasking is continuous and interdependent. This paper clarifies the distinction. Responsibility belongs to the performer who converts intent into action and delivers the agreed output within declared limits of quality, cost, delivery, and time-scale. Accountability remains with the manager-of-work for the integrity of the system in which the task lives—the mandate, capacity, interfaces, guardrails, and review cadence that make responsible execution possible. When the separation is blurred, two predictable failure modes appear: hidden abdication (“I assigned it, so it’s all on you”) and micromanagement (“I’m accountable, so you can’t move without me”). We present a practical model for designing and running this split: define system integrity, assign ownership, frame decision rights and escalation, run short-cycle reviews that examine both execution and the frame, and treat exceptions as learning about the system, not just the individual. A concrete analytics example illustrates how to diagnose responsibility lapses versus accountability failures. The result is a disciplined pattern of work where performers exercise judgment safely and managers steward the frame so each next task is clearer, safer, and faster.

## Introduction
Most managers intend to empower people and protect outcomes. Yet in the press of delivery, language collapses. “Accountable” becomes a synonym for “on the hook,” and “responsible” becomes a vague label for anyone near the work. The consequence is drift. Teams absorb tasks without a viable frame, then get judged for missing outcomes that were unmakeable inside the system as designed. Conversely, managers who fear being “ultimately accountable” suffocate discretion and convert judgment work into step-by-step permission seeking.

This paper re-establishes clean definitions and operating practices. Responsibility is about doing the work right within a stated envelope. Accountability is about ensuring the work is right to do—properly framed, resourced, bounded, connected, and reviewed. Tasking confers responsibility; accountability remains with the manager-of-work who owns system integrity.

## The Core Distinction
Tasking is the contractual moment: a performer accepts responsibility to produce an agreed output by a given date and standard, within specified constraints of quality, cost, delivery, and time-scale. The performer has discretion over method and sequencing inside that envelope and must surface exceptions early.

Accountability is architectural. The manager-of-work remains answerable for the integrity of the system of work that surrounds the task. That includes whether the mandate is clear, the complexity matches the assigned capability, the load is realistic, the interfaces are stable, ethics and legality are protected, and the review cadence is sufficient to detect and correct drift. The performer’s responsibility is executed inside this frame; the manager’s accountability is for the frame.

## What System Integrity Covers
System integrity is the set of preconditions that make responsible execution possible and auditable. It includes the clarity of the mandate—what outcome is promised to whom and by when. It includes capability–complexity fit—whether the performer’s current judgment and skills are appropriate to the time span and ambiguity of the task. It includes capacity and resourcing—reasonable load, tools, and access. It includes guardrails—ethical, legal, and risk boundaries—plus escalation paths that are known and used. It includes cross-team interfaces—stable field names, versioned APIs, agreed handoffs, and service levels. Finally, it includes cadence—planning, review, and learning rituals that keep the frame live rather than static. Ownership of these conditions sits with the manager-of-work.

## What the Performer Owns
The performer owns intent translation into action. That means planning the approach, executing with discipline, and adapting methods within the agreed limits. It includes making local trade-offs consistent with declared priorities and surfacing exceptions as soon as boundary conditions bite. It includes participating in reviews with evidence, not just status. When performance falls short due to effort or skill within an otherwise viable frame, it is a responsibility issue to be coached and corrected.

## What the Manager Owns
The manager-of-work owns the viability of the task as situated in the system. That means sizing scope to capability, setting clear decision rights, and provisioning resources. It means resolving conflicts and dependencies across teams, maintaining stable interfaces, and protecting ethical and safety constraints. It means running the review cadence that tests both execution quality and frame quality. When failure traces to unclear tasking, conflicting priorities, broken interfaces, ambiguous policies, or unrealistic load, it is an accountability issue for the manager to remedy by adjusting the frame.

## Why the Separation Matters
Without this separation, organizations oscillate between two costly extremes. Hidden abdication leaves performers carrying risks they cannot control and breeds cynicism about “accountability.” Micromanagement strips discretion from those closest to the information, slowing decisions and masking systemic defects behind heroic effort. The explicit split restores balance. Performers can exercise judgment inside a safe frame. Managers remain responsible for the health of that frame, not for dictating every move.

## Decision Rights, Escalation, and Boundaries
Decision rights should be explicit before work starts. A simple map is useful. Known and controllable decisions belong locally and should be executed to standard with continuous improvement. Known but less controllable conditions (for example, a vendor dependency) require influence and escalation thresholds. Unknown but controllable work (such as method selection for a novel analysis) invites experimentation within time-boxed limits. Unknown and less controllable risks (like sudden regulatory shifts) require rehearsed escalation and contingency posture. Declaring which decisions are owned, advised, experimented, or escalated—and at what thresholds—turns “trust” into an auditable design choice rather than a vibe.

## Reviews That Reflect the Split
Short-cycle reviews should examine two planes. The performer reports progress against outputs, the status of constraints, and exceptions encountered. The manager interrogates both the work and the frame: were guardrails adequate, was capacity sufficient, were interfaces stable, did decision rights hold, did escalation trigger at the right thresholds? The review’s purpose is improvement at two levels. The performer refines method; the manager repairs the frame. Over time, this dual-loop review converts experience into stronger system integrity, reducing the variance that requires heroics.

## Escalation and Learning
Escalation is not failure; it is the mechanism that keeps responsibility safe and accountability real. When constraints exceed boundaries or the decision map shifts quadrants, the performer escalates with context and options. The manager adapts the frame—clearing dependencies, resetting scope, augmenting resources, or renegotiating targets. Learning flows in both directions. The performer learns better methods; the manager learns where the system’s promises were too tight, too loose, or undefined.

## A Concrete Example
Consider a task: deliver a customer churn model with AUC ≥ 0.80 by March 31, using de-identified data, and publish a validation report. Responsibility sits with the analyst for method, documentation, and validation within that envelope. If the analyst ignores known data quality issues or fails to run required validations, that is a responsibility lapse.

Now test accountability. If the dataset arrives late, the privacy policy is ambiguous, two upstream teams change fields without notice, or the time allowed cannot realistically reach the AUC target given the observable signal, those are system integrity failures. The manager-of-work is accountable for fixing the frame—locking interfaces, clarifying policy, resetting scope, or renegotiating the target. The review should record both threads: what the analyst did with the data and what the system did to the analyst.

## Diagnosing Failure Without Blame-Shifting
When outcomes disappoint, start with a structured diagnostic. First, check frame integrity. Was the mandate unambiguous? Did complexity match placement? Were resources sufficient? Were interfaces and guardrails explicit and stable? Were decision rights and escalation thresholds declared and used? If frame defects are found, remedy them and re-task. Next, examine responsibility. Did the performer plan, execute, adapt, and escalate appropriately inside the stated envelope? Did they meet the standards within their discretion? This sequence prevents reflexive blame on individuals for system faults and prevents system excuses for individual underperformance.

## The Language of Tasking
Clear language makes ownership visible. For the performer: “You are responsible for delivering X by Y, within these parameters.” For the manager-of-work: “I remain accountable for ensuring the frame is coherent—resourcing, interfaces, decision rights, and review. Escalate when boundaries bite; I will adjust the system.” Using these statements at the moment of tasking keeps both sides oriented to their true work.

## Matching Capability, Ability, and Capacity
Responsible tasking depends on three aligned lenses. Ability is the present skill and know-how to do the work. Capability is the judgment to handle the task’s complexity over the required time span. Capacity is the bandwidth to apply ability and capability across the current load. A performer can be highly able yet miscast if the task’s horizon exceeds their current capability. They can be capable yet fail if capacity is overrun. The manager-of-work is accountable for this fit and for staging development so discretion expands as capability and capacity permit.

## Operating Cadence for Principled Speed
A simple cadence sustains the separation while moving quickly. Design the task with a crisp mandate and boundaries. Organize the frame by aligning resources, resolving dependencies, and clarifying decision rights. Execute with short cycles, visible signals, and disciplined escalation. Sustain by running reviews that examine both execution and frame quality, then adjusting standards, interfaces, and guardrails accordingly. This cycle keeps autonomy real and accountability active.

## Common Failure Modes and Remedies
Hidden abdication appears when managers equate assignment with accountability transfer. The remedy is to restate accountability explicitly and audit the frame at kickoff. Micromanagement appears when managers conflate accountability with control. The remedy is to declare decision rights up front and replace permission with visibility and thresholds. Boundary blindness appears when exceptions surface late. The remedy is to teach escalation hygiene and reward timely signals. Interface entropy appears when upstream changes propagate silently. The remedy is to version contracts and include boundary meetings in the review cadence.

## Measures That Matter
Measure responsibility with output-specific indicators: conformance to standards, quality of method, timeliness, and exception handling. Measure accountability with frame indicators: guardrail breaches, dependency latency, rework due to interface change, load realism, and the quality and speed of escalation response. Over time, the mix should shift: fewer frame defects, fewer heroics, faster cycles, and steadier quality at lower cognitive cost.

## Bottom Line
Tasking confers responsibility to act with discretion inside clear limits. Accountability for the conditions and coherence of the system stays with the manager-of-work. When practiced deliberately, this separation turns velocity into principled speed. Performers move faster because boundaries are explicit and trusted. Managers steward the frame so discretion is safe, learning is captured, and the next task launches from a stronger base than the last.

## Six Organizational Stages

[Knowledge Base](https://josejruiz.com/knowledge-base/) > [Organizational Design and Development](https://josejruiz.com/organizational-design-and-development/)

By Jose J. Ruiz

---
## Excerpt

Zero-to-One creativity becomes enduring excellence only when capability migrates from exceptional individuals into resilient systems; this paper codifies the six stages of that journey and shows how DOES leadership reshapes across them to align capability, ability, and capacity at scale.

---
## Abstract

This article formalizes a six-stage framework of organizational development—Stage 0 (“Zero-to-One”) through Stage 5 (“Adaptive Renewal/Excellence”)—drawn from and aligned with the Canonical Concepts & Constructs and the General Glossary of Terms. The stages describe a migration of the locus of capability from individuals to institutions and the corresponding evolution of leadership practice through the **DOES** cycle (Design, Organize, Execute, Sustain). I integrate adjacent research—including Greiner’s phases and crises, Churchill & Lewis’s small-business stages, Adizes’s corporate lifecycle, and dynamic-capabilities theory—to justify stage transitions and failure modes. The paper distinguishes **capability** from **ability** and **capacity** and clarifies the dependency of **individual capacity** on **organizational capability** and structures. The result is a conceptual foundation for stage-specific diagnostics, leadership development, and operating-model design that can be tested empirically and operationalized in practice. 

---
## Introduction

Organizations do not merely grow; they **change form**. Across their journey, they repeatedly encounter thresholds where the prior coordinating mechanism becomes a constraint, triggering a qualitative shift in structure, leadership, and learning. The **Organizational Stages** in the canonical glossary define this developmental trajectory from inception to adaptive maturity and supply the vocabulary used here for definitional precision and systemic alignment. 

This paper has three aims. First, to **anchor the six stages** (Stage 0 plus Stages 1–5) in canonical definition and purpose. Second, to integrate **individual capability** and **organizational capability**—and their relationship to **ability** and **capacity**—as the underlying developmental logic. Third, to show how the **DOES Leadership Model** shifts emphasis across stages, converting strategy into structure, structure into execution, and execution into renewal. 

---

## Foundations: Capability, Ability, and Capacity

### Capability and Ability

**Capability** denotes the aptitude to handle increasing complexity across time horizons—how individuals and organizations **anticipate, decide, and adapt**—distinct from **ability**, which is present-tense, skill-based know-how applied within known conditions.

At the **individual** level, capability reflects judgment and sense-making under ambiguity; it is shaped by experience and governs potential for higher levels of work. At the **organizational** level, capability is the system’s resilience—its governance, processes, and culture that enable coherent sense- and meaning-making beyond any single person.  

### Capacity and Its Dependency

**Capacity** concerns **scale, scope, and volume**—how broadly ability and capability can be applied across teams and timeframes. Critically, **individual capacity** is **relational**: it cannot be sustained without the scaffolding of **organizational capacity** (resources, roles, cadence, tooling). Thus, even extraordinary individuals cannot sustain high throughput in the absence of enabling structures; conversely, robust systems can multiply average individual performance.  

### Cognitive Underpinning

The developmental link between people and structure is illuminated by **Stratified Systems Theory** and Gillian Stamp’s **Mode of Thinking**, which align individual potential capability with levels of work and time span. This alignment explains why mis-matches (e.g., complex roles staffed with purely serial thinkers) degrade execution and learning. 


---

## The Six Organizational Stages

### Stage 0 — Zero-to-One (Visionary Genesis)

#### Definition and Purpose
Stage 0 is the leap from non-existence to **novel value**: the founder articulates a contrarian thesis, discovers problem–solution fit, and produces a first instantiation of something meaningfully **new** rather than incrementally better. Canonically, creation begins with belief and drive before formal systems exist. 

#### Justification and Adjacent Scholarship
Thiel’s “Zero to One” sharpens the distinction between **vertical progress** (0→1 novelty) and **horizontal progress** (1→n replication), clarifying why Stage 0 is categorically different from scaling stages. 

#### Capability, Ability, and Capacity
Capability is intensely **individual**; ability is artisanal craft and hustle; capacity is limited by cash and founder bandwidth. Without rudimentary organizational capability, **individual capacity** will exhaust quickly—highlighting early needs for cadence and minimal structure. 

#### DOES Emphasis
**Design** dominates (hypothesis generation, framing), **Execute** is hands-on, **Organize** is intentionally light, and **Sustain** focuses on resilience habits and cash discipline. 

---

### Stage 1 — Early Framework

#### Definition and Purpose
Basic roles and processes appear; personal effort becomes an initial organizational form. The locus of capability remains with the founder, but **repeatability** emerges.  

#### Justification and Adjacent Scholarship
Greiner’s early “creativity” phase ends in a **crisis of leadership**, where a single overseer can no longer coordinate everything—propelling the shift toward direction and basic management.  

#### Capability, Ability, and Capacity
Individual capability is still the primary driver; **organizational capability** appears as simple routines and metrics. Individual capacity expands only as organizational capacity (people, rhythm, tooling) grows. 

#### DOES Emphasis
**Execute** and **Design** remain prominent; **Organize** introduces clarity of roles and basic cadence; **Sustain** is reactive but intentional (after-action reviews, founder self-care).  

---

### Stage 2 — Growth Acceleration

#### Definition and Purpose
Demand outpaces structure; coordination becomes the constraint. Stronger prioritization and formalization are required to **sustain** growth.
#### Justification and Adjacent Scholarship
Churchill & Lewis’s model shows the owner’s role shifting from doer to **manager**, while Greiner predicts a crisis of direction giving way to **delegation** and planning. 

#### Capability, Ability, and Capacity
**Organizational capability** begins to **substitute** for individual heroics via SOPs and basic governance. This substitution is multiplicative: it raises **organizational capacity**, allowing more work at higher reliability with the same talent. 
#### DOES Emphasis
**Organize** rises (resource management, talent alignment, communication), **Execute** becomes process-based, **Design** shifts to roadmaps, and **Sustain** formalizes reviews and compliance.  

---

### Stage 3 — Operational Maturity

#### Definition and Purpose
Execution stabilizes; management layers, accountability, and empowered teams replace heroics with **reliable, repeatable performance**.  
#### Justification and Adjacent Scholarship
Greiner anticipates a **crisis of coordination** as silos form; the remedy is integrative mechanisms and planning disciplines that align end-to-end value streams. 

#### Capability, Ability, and Capacity
Organizational capability—now embodied in cross-functional governance and shared methods—drives throughput. Individual capacity expands through **system fluency** more than raw skill, as roles require navigation across interdependencies. 

#### DOES Emphasis
**Design** becomes system design (operating models), **Organize** orchestrates cross-functional work, **Execute** emphasizes cycle time and quality, **Sustain** institutionalizes continuous improvement and knowledge management. 

---

### Stage 4 — Strategic Coherence

#### Definition and Purpose
Leadership aligns **vision, systems, and accountability**; strategy integrates foresight, ethics, and risk into a coherent direction across portfolios, geographies, or platforms. 
#### Justification and Adjacent Scholarship
**Dynamic-capabilities** research explains performance advantages where firms can **sense**, **seize**, and **reconfigure**—organizational capabilities that must be embedded beyond any individual. 

#### Capability, Ability, and Capacity
Enterprise capability becomes the **dominant** performance driver; individual capacity scales through roles that allocate resources, orchestrate talent markets, and shape culture. This is where **organizational capacity** (scope, scale, volume) most visibly multiplies outcomes. 

#### DOES Emphasis
**Design** becomes strategy-as-learning; **Organize** links strategy to resource orchestration and culture building; **Execute** balances scale efficiency with local responsiveness; **Sustain** emphasizes resilience, risk ethics, and leadership pipelines. 

---

### Stage 5 — Adaptive Renewal (Institutionalized Excellence)

#### Definition and Purpose
Learning and agility define success; the organization continually **evolves**, balancing stability with innovation to sustain long-term relevance and performance.

#### Justification and Adjacent Scholarship
Adizes warns of the slide from **Prime** into bureaucratic decline; sustained excellence requires renewal systems that protect identity while refreshing strategy and design. **Dynamic-capabilities** again provide the microfoundations for persistent advantage. 

#### Capability, Ability, and Capacity
Capability is now **institutional**: values, culture, governance, and routines carry adaptation forward. Individual capacity expresses through stewardship—shaping future conditions, not merely operating within present ones. 

#### DOES Emphasis
**Sustain** becomes generative (foresight, innovation leadership, resilience, change, sustainability), while **Design** curates long-horizon bets, **Organize** keeps the architecture adaptive, and **Execute** remains world-class through continuous learning.

## Justifying Stage Boundaries with Adjacent Scholarship

### Evolution–Revolution Dynamics
Greiner’s cross-industry synthesis demonstrates that growth proceeds through **evolutionary periods** punctuated by predictable **crises** (leadership, autonomy/direction, coordination, bureaucracy), each requiring a new managerial logic. This empirical pattern undergirds the step-changes described in Stages 1–5. 
### Small-Business Progression and the Owner’s Role
Churchill & Lewis show how the owner’s role evolves from hands-on operator to strategic manager, mirroring the migration of capability from person to system central to Stage 1→3 transitions. 
### Lifecycle Risks and Renewal
Adizes’s lifecycle identifies **Prime** as the delicate balance of flexibility and control; without explicit renewal (Stage 5), organizations drift into aristocracy and decline—clarifying the necessity of **Sustain** at advanced stages. 
### Microfoundations of Renewal
Dynamic-capabilities theory provides the **how** of Stage 4–5: firms outperform when they routinize **sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring** amid change—capabilities that are, by design, **organizational**, not merely individual.  
### The Uniqueness of Stage 0
“Zero-to-One” clarifies that Stage 0 pursues vertical progress—non-incremental novelty—requiring Design-heavy leadership and minimal structure until repeatability emerges.

## How DOES Leadership Evolves by Stage

### Rebalancing the Cycle

The **DOES Leadership Model** is universal—expressed at every level and horizon—but its **relative emphasis** shifts with stage complexity. In early stages, Design and Execute dominate; mid-stages elevate Organize to convert ingenuity into throughput; advanced stages privilege Sustain to embed renewal, ethics, and resilience. 

### Stage-Specific Expressions

#### Stage 0–1
Design frames contrarian theses and product learning; Execute is founder-led craft; Organize installs only the lightest scaffolding; Sustain preserves founder energy and cash runway. 
#### Stage 2
Organize formalizes roles, budgets, and cross-functional collaboration so that ability scales; Sustain adds governance cadence; Design becomes roadmap-driven. 
#### Stage 3
Design operates at system level; Organize coordinates across functions; Execute targets reliability and cycle time; Sustain institutionalizes continuous improvement and knowledge systems. 
#### Stage 4–5
Design becomes strategy-as-learning and optioncraft; Organize orchestrates portfolios and culture; Execute balances scale with local context; Sustain stewards identity, resilience, leadership development, change, and sustainability thinking.

## Implications and Propositions for Further Work

### Diagnostic Implications
Stage diagnosis should assess the **dominant constraint** (e.g., coordination vs. agility), the **current DOES balance**, and the **capability mix** (individual vs. organizational). Canonical definitions make this assessment coherent across engagements. 
### Propositions

#### P1 — Crisis-Capability Fit
Organizations advance stages when the prevailing coordinating mechanism fails to resolve the core constraint, necessitating a different DOES balance; this is consistent with Greiner’s evolution–revolution dynamic. 
#### P2 — Embedding Gradient
From Stage 2 onward, the share of performance variance explained by **organizational capability** increases monotonically; by Stage 5, dynamic capabilities are primarily institutional.  
#### P3 — Capacity Is Relational
**Individual capacity** cannot be sustained without **organizational capacity**; measured improvements in throughput under constant headcount should track investments in structure, cadence, and tooling. 
#### P4 — Cognitive–Role Alignment
Alignment between **Mode of Thinking** (potential capability) and **Level of Work** predicts performance at stage transitions; mis-matches degrade quality and increase cycle time.  
#### P5 — Stewardship as a Safeguard
Without **Sustain** disciplines, organizations at Stage 4 will drift; stewardship practices preserve identity while enabling renewal.

## Conclusion

Progress from Zero-to-One to Adaptive Excellence is not a straight line of scale; it is a **sequence of form changes**. Each stage reassigns the work of leadership across DOES, gradually relocating capability from exceptional people to resilient systems. Distinguishing capability, ability, and capacity—and recognizing the dependency of individual capacity on organizational capability—equips leaders to design the **next form** before crisis compels it. This staged lens provides a researchable map for diagnostics, development, and operating-model design across the Management Horizon.
