## Executive Search Aligned with Capability and Complexity


## A systemic executive search process aligning individual capability with organizational complexity to ensure lasting performance, alignment, and meaningful impact.

At Alder Koten, executive search is not about filling positions. It is about aligning capability with complexity—where individual judgment meets organizational purpose. Every engagement begins with a deep understanding of strategic intent, organizational stage, and cultural context. We look beyond resumes to ensure that leadership capacity matches the level of complexity an organization must navigate to achieve its goals.

Our process is anchored in the Anker Bioss Framework, a systemic architecture that connects how individuals think, decide, and create meaning with the organization’s ability to sustain performance over time. Through this lens, we evaluate not just who can do the job, but who can help the organization evolve.

By aligning individual capability, organizational capability, and strategic complexity, we ensure that every placement strengthens both immediate execution and long-term resilience.
## Discovery Phase

We begin by understanding the organization as a living system. This phase involves analyzing strategic plans, governance structures, and cultural dynamics to reveal the organization’s true stage of development. We identify what the organization requires—and what it can sustain—clarifying role expectations, interdependencies, and the leadership attributes needed to enhance collective performance.

This diagnostic foundation defines the fit between individual and institution, ensuring the search is anchored in both strategic purpose and systemic readiness.
## Fit Definition Stage

The position specification becomes the benchmark for evaluation. It articulates the role’s scope, complexity, and leadership contribution across three essential dimensions of fit:
### Fit to Profile
We define the required profile through the integrated relationship between capability, ability, and capacity:
#### Capability 
Capability reflects how individuals interpret and respond to complexity, demonstrating cognitive depth, judgment, and sense-making in uncertain conditions.
#### Ability
Ability encompasses the applied skills, knowledge, and experience that enable consistent execution and performance in defined contexts.
#### Capacity
Capacity expresses the extent to which capability and ability can be effectively scaled across scope, systems, and time to meet the role’s demands.
### Fit to Company Stage

We analyze the organization’s maturity, systems, and culture to determine how these elements amplify or constrain performance. A leader who thrives in one stage of development may struggle in another; understanding this relationship ensures sustainable success.
### Fit to Challenge

We match the complexity of the strategic challenge with the traits the ideal candidate requires. 

Using the Anker Bioss Framework, we establish the position’s Level of Work (the timespan and complexity of decisions they can manage) and Mode of Thinking (how they make sense of complexity).

This multidimensional definition ensures that the search identifies leaders who are not only competent but also contextually aligned with the organization’s evolution.

## Talent Search Phase

We translate the project specification into a structured search strategy that targets relevant industries, organizations, and leadership ecosystems. Every outreach focuses on identifying individuals whose cognitive orientation, leadership behavior, and cultural alignment match the client’s strategic horizon—not merely their industry pedigree.

Our goal is to surface candidates capable of both delivering in the present and designing the future.
## Assessment and Evaluation Phase

Each candidate is assessed through a rigorous, comparative process that measures not only what they have achieved but how they think, decide, and operate across the three Management Horizons:
#### Present Horizon
The Present Horizon emphasizes consistent delivery, operational reliability, and effective execution—demonstrating how leaders ensure stability and performance in the current system.
#### Future Horizon
The Future Horizon focuses on transformation, guiding strategic evolution, and positioning the organization to adapt, innovate, and thrive amid changing conditions.
#### Enduring Horizon
The Enduring Horizon focuses on sustaining cultural coherence, long-term systems, and values that ensure continuity, purpose, and resilience across generations of leadership.
### Evaluation Tools

We integrate multiple tools in the executive search process to evaluate fit and alignment:
#### Hogan Assessments (HPI, HDS, MVPI)
The Hogan suite evaluates personality drivers, potential derailers, and underlying values that shape motivation, leadership behavior, and interpersonal effectiveness. It helps predict how individuals will perform, relate, and sustain effectiveness under both everyday and high-pressure conditions, offering insight into long-term leadership potential and risk.
#### BIOSS Career Path Appreciation (CPA)
The CPA identifies an individual’s Mode of Thinking—how they make sense of complexity—and Level of Work—the scale and timespan of decisions they can effectively manage. It reveals cognitive patterns that determine a leader’s current and future capacity to navigate uncertainty, structure decisions, and enable strategic alignment.
#### Luks Prisma Leadership Assessment
The Luks Prisma Leadership Assessment explores leadership style, role preference, and motivational drivers across six dimensions, providing a nuanced picture of how leaders think, act, and engage within systems. It ensures alignment between natural leadership expression, organizational culture, and the role’s systemic and developmental requirements.

This phase transforms data into insight—illuminating how leaders will respond to complexity, shape teams, and sustain flow within the organizational system.
## Presentation and Interview Phase

Shortlisted candidates are presented through confidential reports that integrate biographical detail with strategic interpretation. Each report includes education, training, experience, and—most critically—our analysis of the candidate’s fit across the defined dimensions: profile, stage, and challenge.

These presentations enable our clients to engage in interviews informed by clarity, not conjecture.
## Validation Phase
We conduct 360-degree reference checks and academic verifications within the defined framework. References are used not only to confirm performance history but to validate how the candidate contributes to capability, aligns with culture, and sustains results across time horizons.

## Offer Phase
The offer stage is navigated as a process of alignment, not negotiation. We facilitate transparent dialogue between candidate and client, ensuring the agreement reflects shared expectations, purpose, and growth potential. Our role is to balance interests and ensure that the relationship begins with clarity and mutual trust.

## Transition Phase
Our engagement extends beyond the signed offer. We remain connected through resignation, onboarding, and integration to ensure early success and sustained alignment.

Through the Anker Bioss perspective, we provide post-placement feedback that supports both leader and organization in achieving flow—the state where challenge and capability balance to create high performance and deep engagement.
This final step transforms hiring into a systemic intervention, ensuring that individual capability amplifies organizational capacity rather than being constrained by it.
## Status and Reporting

A structured process brings certainty to the uncertainty of search. Throughout the engagement, we provide progress reports and insight notes summarizing outreach outcomes, candidate responses, and strategic observations.

We recommend review calls every two weeks to ensure synchronization and alignment as the process evolves. Transparency, rhythm, and shared accountability form the foundation of every successful search.

## Working with Jose J. Ruiz on Executive Search Projects

Executive search, when done well, is a form of organizational design. It is not about acquiring talent—it is about ensuring that the right individual, with the right capability and judgment, enters the right system at the right moment in its evolution.

When individual capability meets organizational complexity in flow, performance becomes sustainable, culture becomes coherent, and leadership becomes legacy.

[Jose J Ruiz](https://linkedin.com/in/josejruiz) leverages his leadership at Alder Koten and Anker Bioss to have both organizations operate in synergy—combining precision in search with depth in assessment—to help organizations build leadership teams that flow, evolve, and anchor meaningful work.

## History and Timeline of Alder Koten


## [Alder Koten](https://alderkoten.com/) was founded in February 2011 in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico, by Silvia Flores, who envisioned a firm dedicated to aligning leadership capability with organizational complexity. 

From its inception, the firm focused on helping clients build leadership teams that not only perform but evolve—bridging talent strategy, organizational design, and purpose-driven leadership. Jose J. Ruiz supported the founding as Chairman of the Board, contributing strategic guidance and systemic frameworks that would later shape the firm’s consulting philosophy.

Later that same year, Silvia relocated to Houston, Texas, and Alder Koten moved its headquarters to The Woodlands, TX, positioning the firm to serve cross-border clients operating across Mexico and the United States. The early years were marked by rapid growth and the establishment of a leadership team that reflected the firm’s international reach and commitment to excellence.

In June 2012, Jorge Dávalos joined as Managing Partner in the Houston office, strengthening the firm’s executive search capabilities in North America. Simultaneously, Felipe Llaguno joined as Managing Partner in Monterrey, anchoring the firm’s presence in Northern Mexico and supporting industrial and manufacturing clients.

A year later, in June 2013, Jose J. Ruiz formally assumed the role of CEO and Managing Partner, integrating the firm’s search practice with a more systemic approach to leadership evaluation and organizational alignment. That same year, in October 2013, Carlos Solórzano joined as Managing Partner in Guadalajara, Mexico, expanding the firm’s national footprint and client reach.

On August 24, 2014, Alder Koten became a member of the IMD International Search Group, a global executive search organization founded in 1972. IMD is composed of independently owned firms operating in more than 20 countries, collaborating to conduct senior executive and board-level searches across borders. Each member retains its identity and autonomy while sharing IMD’s commitment to quality, ethics, and cultural fit. This partnership positioned Alder Koten as a bridge between America and global markets, enabling clients to access world-class talent and leadership insight through an integrated global network.

In 2021, Jose J. Ruiz was elected President of IMD International Search Group, leading the network through a period of modernization and global collaboration. In May 2025, he transitioned from President to Chairman of IMD, where he continues to guide the organization’s strategic direction and governance.

Most recently, in June 2023, Gilda Ramos joined Alder Koten as Engagement Manager in the Houston office, further strengthening the firm’s executive recruiting and candidate engagement capabilities.

Today, Alder Koten is a boutique executive search and leadership advisory firm with nine partners. Its headquarters are located in Houston and it has offices in Guadalajara, Monterrey, and Mexico City with partner firms in New York, Boston, Chicago, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Hong Kong, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and United Kingdom. The firm continues to operate at the intersection of executive search, leadership assessment, and organizational alignment—anchored by the conviction that meaningful work, when enabled by capable leadership and coherent systems, is the foundation of enduring organizational success.

Alder Koten, as an executive search and leadership advisory firm, is built on the principle that executive search is not about filling positions—it’s about aligning talent capability with organizational capability, and the challenge at hand. From its inception, the firm differentiated itself by integrating deep leadership assessment and organizational diagnostics into every search engagement.

## The Finance Function

## Finance and Resource Management — Core Elements
Finance turns ambiguity into an actionable constraint. By connecting forecasts to strategy and illuminating unit economics, it guides decisions on timing, pace, and risk. The day-to-day engine—accurate transactions, timely closes, crisp variance explanations—provides the rhythm that allows leaders to steer with confidence. As the organization grows, finance expands reporting capacity and scenario analysis without drowning decision-makers in noise. This balance—narratives that make numbers meaningful, systems that keep numbers trustworthy—lets capital flow where it compounds, not just where it is most visible.

## Mandate
- Strategic allocation of financial resources, optimization of cash flow, and stewardship for long-term growth aligned to business objectives with agility and transparency.
- Forecasting, budgeting, transparent reporting, and disciplined risk management tightly linked to strategy.

## Pillars (Finance Competencies)
1. **Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A)** — forecasting, budgeting, variance analysis, and aligning plans with enterprise goals; cross-functional collaboration to guide decisions.  
2. **Revenue & Profit Optimization** — pricing strategy, revenue stream management, profitability monitoring, and responsiveness to market shifts.  
3. **Treasury & Cash-Flow Management** — liquidity and working-capital control, capital-structure balance (debt/equity), and financing strategy.  
4. **Asset Management & Utilization** — valuation and optimization of tangible/intangible assets, CapEx planning, and lifecycle management to maximize ROI and continuity.  
5. **Risk Management & Compliance** — identification and mitigation of financial risks, robust internal controls and audits, and adherence to reporting standards (e.g., GAAP/IFRS).

## Key Roles
- CFO, FP&A leaders and analysts, budget managers, pricing strategists, revenue managers, treasurers, and asset managers.

## Operating Interfaces & Enablers
- Close partnership with operations on capital allocation, working capital, and performance management.  
- Data analytics and automation to improve forecasting, reporting quality, and efficiency.  
- Global capabilities for currency-risk management and international compliance.
