# Anker Bioss General Glossary of Terms

Strictly adhere to the use of these words as defined in the following glossary of terms. Do not use these words if the strict definition is not what is defined here. 
### Ability
Ability is the practical skill and know-how to perform tasks effectively within a given role. Unlike capability, which reflects potential across time horizons, ability is grounded in applied knowledge, skills, and experience. It represents what can be reliably executed in the present and can be developed further through practice. ,
#### Autonomy Paradox
The Autonomy Paradox describes the tension between the human desire for freedom and the simultaneous need for structure and certainty. Too much control stifles creativity, while unlimited freedom creates disorientation. Effective leadership balances autonomy with clarity, enabling individuals and organizations to thrive in environments that demand both safety and stretch.
### Capability
Capability is the capacity to handle complexity across time horizons, reflecting judgment, sense-making, and potential beyond immediate tasks. Unlike ability, which is skill-based, capability shapes how individuals and organizations anticipate, decide, and adapt. It grows through experience, reflection, and development, enabling effectiveness in increasingly complex and uncertain environments.
- **Individual Capability** — Individual capability is the depth of judgment and sense-making a person brings to complex and uncertain situations. It reflects how one interprets ambiguity, recognizes patterns, and creates direction when no clear roadmap exists. Shaped by experience and reflection, it underpins effective leadership and meaningful contribution in evolving contexts.
- **Organizational Capability** — Organizational capability is the organization’s strength in dealing with complexity. It reflects the collective resilience of its systems, structures, and culture in sense-making and meaning-making. Rooted in governance, processes, and collaboration, it aligns people and strategy to sustain performance, adapt to uncertainty, and deliver coherence beyond individual contributions.w that endures beyond individuals.
### Capacity
Capacity combines volume, scale, and scope. It measures how broadly ability and capability can be applied across teams, systems, and timeframes. Capacity depends on both personal maturity and organizational strength, as even the most capable individual cannot sustain high performance without supportive structures, resources, and a resilient institutional capability.
- **Organizational Capacity** — Individual capacity is the scale of how broadly a person applies ability and capability across teams, systems, and timeframes. It reflects influence, coordination, and operating across domains. Shaped by personal maturity and systemic support, it is relational—high capacity cannot be sustained without the scaffolding and structure of organizational capacity. 
- **Organizational Capacity** — Organizational capacity is the scale, scope, and volume of work an institution can sustain with its available resources, time, and people. It defines how broadly initiatives can be executed and coordinated. Unlike capability, which reflects strength in complexity, capacity marks the organization’s practical limits of throughput and reach.
### DOES Leadership Model

### Experience
Experience is the lived process of applying knowledge and skills in real-world situations, where success, failure, and reflection lead to deeper learning. It is developed through exposure, repetition, and challenge, but its value lies in how it shapes judgment. In organizations, experience becomes communal when after-action reviews, coaching, and rotations transform individual lessons into shared insight. 
#### Flow
Flow is a psychological state where challenge and capability are balanced, enabling deep focus, intrinsic motivation, and optimal performance. In this state, individuals lose track of time, feel fully absorbed, and experience clarity of action. Flow fosters learning, creativity, and sustained energy, turning effort into meaningful achievement.
### Competence
Competence is the demonstrated integration of knowledge, skills, and judgment applied effectively in specific contexts. It reflects not just what someone knows, but how reliably they perform under real conditions. Built through practice and experience, competence translates potential into consistent execution, making it a practical benchmark of readiness and effectiveness.

#### Competency
Competency is the integration of knowledge, skills, and behaviors that enable effective performance in a specific context or level of work. It represents the observable expression of underlying capability, aligning cognitive capacity, emotional intelligence, and technical proficiency with the complexity and purpose of the role ￼.
#### Current Level of Capability
Current Level of Capability refers to the complexity of work an individual can handle effectively at present. It reflects their capacity to process information, make judgments, and deliver consistent, valued results under existing conditions, without assuming potential future growth or development .
### Judgment
Judgement, in the BIOSS framework, is the process of weighing factors, knowledge, experience, and non-verbalized insight to reach a decision. It represents the human capacity to act amid uncertainty, where knowledge and experience may be insufficient. Good judgement balances intuition and analysis, transforming ambiguity into coherent, purposeful action
### Knowledge
Knowledge is the accumulation of information, facts, and understanding gained through learning, study, or experience. It forms the raw material from which ability develops, providing the foundation for skills and competencies. Unlike capability, which interprets complexity, knowledge represents what is already known, codified, and transferable across people and contexts.
#### Leadership
Leadership is the practice of creating direction, fostering alignment, and sustaining commitment in the face of complexity. It is not confined to position or authority but expressed through judgment, influence, and sense-making. Leadership balances present demands with future possibilities, enabling people and organizations to adapt, cohere, and thrive.
#### Levels of Work
Levels of Work describe the hierarchy of complexity within organizations, defining the scale, scope, and time span of decision-making at each level. Each level represents a distinct pattern of judgment and responsibility, aligning cognitive capability with role demands to ensure effective alignment between people, work, and organizational purpose ￼
- **Level of Work 1:** Quality focuses on producing consistent, accurate, and tangible results within clearly defined parameters.

#### Meaning-Making 
Meaning-Making is the second stage in the Progression of Meaningful Response, asking “What does this mean?” It connects events to purpose, values, and identity, transforming disorientation into direction. By contextualizing change within broader narratives, meaning-making enables leaders and organizations to align emotion with significance, turning uncertainty into focused energy.
#### Nature of Work
Nature of Work refers to the inherent complexity, scope, and time span of tasks required within a role. It defines the level of judgment, uncertainty, and interdependence involved, determining how work must be structured, coordinated, and aligned with the individual’s capability to ensure effective performance
#### Mode of Thinking
Mode of Thinking is the underlying cognitive structure that determines how an individual processes complexity, handles uncertainty, and manages time horizons. It reflects potential capability—the highest level of work complexity one can eventually manage—progressing from concrete, fact-based reasoning to abstract, systemic integration of interdependent variables ￼.
#### Sense-Making
Sense-making is the process of interpreting volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) to create shared meaning and direction. It requires discerning patterns in chaos, clarifying shifting conditions, and framing challenges without precedent. In organizations, sense-making aligns perspectives and enables coherent action when environments are unstable, unpredictable, intricate, and unclear.
#### Skills
Skills are learned proficiencies that enable effective execution of tasks in known or knowable conditions. Developed through practice, repetition, and exposure, they translate knowledge into action and form the building blocks of ability. Skills range from technical expertise to interpersonal effectiveness and support consistent, reliable performance within established contexts.
### Organization
An organization is a living system that evolves from founder-driven momentum to institutional stewardship. It balances individual capability with structures and processes, aligning talent, leadership, and strategy to meet rising complexity. At its best, it becomes an adaptive ecosystem that sustains purpose, fosters trust, and delivers lasting contributions.
### Organizational Stages
The Organizational Stages describe the developmental journey of an enterprise from inception to adaptive maturity. Each stage reflects increasing structural complexity, strategic coherence, and systemic capability. Progression depends on aligning leadership, systems, and culture with growing organizational demands—transforming vision into structure, structure into strategy, and strategy into sustainable renewal.
- **Stage Zero: Visionary Genesis:** Creation begins with belief and drive. The founder’s vision shapes the organization before systems, roles, or structure exist.
- **Stage One: Early Framework:** Basic structures emerge. Founders build early processes and roles, transforming personal effort into an initial, resilient organizational form.
- **Stage Two: Growth Acceleration:** Expansion outpaces structure. Rapid scaling introduces complexity, requiring stronger coordination and prioritization to sustain growth and opportunity.
- **Stage Three: Operational Maturity:** Systems stabilize execution. Management layers, clear accountability, and empowered teams replace heroics with reliable, repeatable performance.
- **Stage Four: Strategic Coherence:** Governance and leadership align vision, systems, and accountability. Strategy integrates foresight, ethics, and risk into coherent organizational direction.
- **Stage Five: Adaptive Renewal:** Learning and agility define success. The organization evolves continuously, balancing stability with innovation to sustain long-term relevance and performance.
#### Personality
Personality is the organized pattern of enduring traits, emotions, and behaviors that shape how an individual perceives, decides, and interacts with the world. It reflects consistent tendencies in response to complexity, uncertainty, and relationships, influencing motivation, leadership style, and alignment between self, role, and context ￼.
#### Progression of Meaningful Response
*Progression of Meaningful Response* is the structured flow of cognitive disciplines—Sense-Making, Meaning-Making, Framing, and Solving—that guide how individuals and organizations navigate challenges. It moves from perceiving and interpreting reality, to defining what matters, to taking purposeful action, ensuring responses remain coherent, adaptive, and aligned in complex, uncertain conditions.
- **Sense-Making** — Sense-Making is the first stage in the *Progression of Meaningful Response*, asking “What is happening?” It is the act of orienting in volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity by scanning environments, discerning patterns, and stabilizing perception. Sense-making builds shared understanding, enabling individuals and organizations to interpret turbulent or unclear conditions.
- **Meaning-Making** — Meaning-Making is the second stage in the Progression of Meaningful Response, asking “What does this mean?” It connects events to purpose, values, and identity, transforming disorientation into direction. By contextualizing change within broader narratives, meaning-making enables leaders and organizations to align emotion with significance, turning uncertainty into focused energy.
- **Framing** — Framing is the third stage in the Progression of Meaningful Response, asking “What do we need to solve?” It defines the challenge by choosing the lens through which a problem is viewed. Framing turns uncertainty into strategic focus, ensuring collective effort addresses the right issue and unlocks productive action.
- **Solving** — Solving is the fourth stage in the Progression of Meaningful Response, asking “How do we solve this?” It applies logic, expertise, and structured methods to design and implement solutions. Dependent on prior sense-making, meaning-making, and framing, solving transforms clarity into tangible results, delivering coherent action in complex conditions.
