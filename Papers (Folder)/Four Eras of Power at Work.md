## Abstract
This article proposes a four-era hypothesis for how power organizes work, each era defined by the asset that constitutes the decisive choke point: protection, land, industrial capital, and knowledge-plus-reach. In the protection era, authority accrues to actors who can reliably suppress violence and coordinate risk, formalized in the social-contract tradition and protection–racket theses and modeled as the “stationary bandit” (Hobbes, 1651/1996; Olson, 1993; Tilly, 1985). In the agrarian era, control of arable land and water anchors hierarchy and revenue, with feudal tenure and hydraulic administration structuring obligations (Sahlins, 1963; Wittfogel, 1957; Scott, 2017). In the industrial era, ownership and managerial coordination of plant, equipment, and logistics become decisive, separating ownership from control and scaling wage labor through corporate forms (Berle & Means, 1932; Chandler, 1977). In the information era, proprietary know-how, data, algorithms, and network reach centralize intermediation and attention, generating platform power and regulatory concern (Drucker, 1993; Castells, 2010; Katz & Shapiro, 1985; Rochet & Tirole, 2003; Parker & Van Alstyne, 2005; Zuboff, 2019; Simon, 1971). The framework aids diagnosis of sectoral power by identifying the active choke point and aligning work design, governance, and strategy accordingly.

## Four Eras of Power at Work
Power at work concentrates where control over a scarce, consequential asset confers leverage over risk, throughput, or coordination. The four-era hypothesis asserts a sequence—protection, land, industrial capital, and knowledge-plus-reach—each pairing an asset of record with a characteristic institution and labor regime. Canonical role distinctions among capability, capacity, and levels of work provide a consistent lens for comparing eras and avoiding category errors.

## Review of Literature and Theoretical Evolution

### Protection First: Power from Providing Safety
Early concentrations of power arise where actors can monopolize coercion and sell peace for tribute. Hobbes framed legitimate rule as a bargain to escape mutual predation under a sovereign able to guarantee safety (Hobbes, 1651/1996). Historical sociology recasts state formation as organized protection, often resembling a protection racket that becomes normalized as rule (Tilly, 1985). Olson’s model of the stationary bandit explains why rulers with a long time horizon prefer taxation plus protection over roving plunder, since credible risk reduction raises output (Olson, 1993). Ethnographic cases from Melanesia and Polynesia show big men and chiefs accruing prestige by coordinating defense and redistribution before formal states crystallize (Sahlins, 1963). The validation signals of this era are clear: legitimacy grounded in safety, revenue as tribute or tax, and work aligned under leaders who mobilize defense and coordinate risk-sharing.

### Land Next: Power from Owning and Organizing Agriculture
When wealth is produced chiefly on fields, title to land and control of water become the master keys. Feudal and manorial institutions formalized hierarchical tenure and obligations, while hydraulic civilizations centralized flood control and irrigation, entwining sovereignty with river management (Wittfogel, 1957). Revisionist accounts caution that early agrarian states often deepened coercion and worsened well-being even as they scaled surplus extraction, underscoring how asset control can degrade work while increasing output (Scott, 2017). In this era, the fiscal base is ground rent and harvest tax, and the labor regime is serfdom, tenancy, and corvée flowing upward to lords and bureaucracies; status, law, and military obligation track control of the soil and the water that makes it productive (Sahlins, 1963; Scott, 2017).

### Industrial Turn: Power from Owning the Means of Production
Mechanization, rail, and telegraph re-centered power on capital goods and the administrative capacity to coordinate them. The modern corporation separates ownership from control, embedding decision rights in professional managers who orchestrate multiunit enterprises across vast geographies (Berle & Means, 1932; Chandler, 1977). Industrial logistics, standardization, and accounting tighten coordination, raising returns to scale and scope while transforming labor into disciplined wage work contested by unions and scientific management. The revenue model is profit from scale, scope, and throughput; the work logic is wage labor governed by corporate charters and managerial hierarchies that eclipse manorial authority.

### Information Age: Power from Knowledge and Reach
As value migrates to ideas, code, data, and networks, knowledge and reach become co-equal sources of power. Drucker anticipated a knowledge economy in which applied know-how eclipses both land and capital (Drucker, 1993). Castells theorized a network society whose space of flows reorganizes coordination around information networks rather than fixed assets (Castells, 2010). Platform economics formalizes how two-sided markets and network effects concentrate power in intermediaries that can subsidize one side, attract the other, and steer interactions through standards and algorithms (Katz & Shapiro, 1985; Rochet & Tirole, 2003; Parker & Van Alstyne, 2005). As information saturates experience, attention becomes the gating scarcity, shifting rents toward those who can govern distribution and defaults (Simon, 1971). Critical accounts warn that platform reach and data extraction can mutate into behavioral control, prompting regulatory responses (Zuboff, 2019). The revenue logic is data, attention, and intermediation; the work logic is knowledge and creative production mediated by platforms, APIs, and standards.

### Cross-Era Synthesis
A continuity of the security bargain runs through all four eras: safety legitimizes authority, first as physical protection, then as food security, later as job and credit security, and now as cybersecurity and information integrity (Hobbes, 1651/1996; Tilly, 1985; Olson, 1993; Zuboff, 2019). Assets of record pair with coordination technologies: land and water require territorial hierarchies; machines and rail or telegraph require managerial hierarchies; code and networks require protocols and platform governance (Chandler, 1977; Castells, 2010). The locus of scarcity migrates from material throughput to interaction throughput and ultimately attention, rendering default interfaces, app stores, and standards powerful choke points (Simon, 1971; Rochet & Tirole, 2003). Within eras, power also re-distributes: the industrial visible hand moved authority from owners to professional managers; platforms shift leverage from content owners to distributors and recommender systems (Berle & Means, 1932; Chandler, 1977; Katz & Shapiro, 1985).

## Conclusion
The sequence—safety, land, industrial capital, knowledge-plus-reach—offers a parsimonious account of how assets, institutions, and labor regimes co-evolve to organize work. Each era elevates a distinct bottleneck, then builds the institutional and fiscal machinery to control it. Leaders can use this framework diagnostically: locate the genuine choke point in a sector—security, land-like concessions including spectrum rights, capital intensity, or distributional reach—and align work design, governance, talent, and capital allocation to that constraint. Anticipate conflict at the seams: enclosure and urbanization in land-to-industry transitions; standards wars, intellectual property battles, and antitrust in the shift from industrial to platform power. The hypothesis does not deny hybridity; it clarifies where power sits now and how it is likely to migrate as coordination technologies change (Ruiz, 2025a).
