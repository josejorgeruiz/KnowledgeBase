## Excerpt

Contribution Bands (CB6) and Elliott Jaques’ Levels of Work (LoW) share a common concern with time span and decision complexity, yet they begin from different anchors. LoW is anchored on the work that is performed—the time span and complexity designed into a role. CB6 is centered on the individual—the band on a spectrum where a person reliably performs in flow—and treats bands as zones with fuzzy edges, including bridge bands at the overlaps of horizons. When paired with Capability (potential to handle complexity) and Mode of Thinking (how a person makes sense of complexity), the four constructs become complementary lenses: LoW clarifies the job, Capability and Mode of Thinking illuminate the person’s potential and pattern of sensemaking, and CB6 locates the person’s reliable contribution-in-practice, including how they interpret and translate direction across horizons. Together they enable humane placement, safer stretch, and coherent governance.

## Abstract

This paper distinguishes CB6 from LoW and shows how both can be complemented by Capability and Mode of Thinking. LoW stratifies roles by the time span of discretion and associated decision complexity; it is role-anchored. CB6 is individual-anchored: it places people on a contribution spectrum where they are consistently effective and in flow, including bridge contributions at the overlaps of horizons (e.g., Present↔Future; Future↔Enduring). Capability (Jaques & Cason) addresses a person’s potential capacity to handle complexity over time, while Mode of Thinking (Stamp) describes characteristic ways of making sense of and acting within complexity and uncertainty. The paper presents a conceptual cross-walk, practical integration patterns, and propositions for research. The conclusion argues that CB6, Capability, Mode of Thinking, and LoW are mutually reinforcing when LoW specifies the work, Capability and Mode of Thinking estimate potential and pattern, and CB6 calibrates reliable, evidence-based contribution and stretch.

## Introduction

The promise of any placement framework is to reduce role risk while accelerating development and performance. LoW contributed a durable insight: time span of discretion—how long a decision must stand without additional direction—tracks the complexity designed into work and can therefore stratify roles and managerial accountability. That insight remains useful in contemporary organizations.  

CB6 shares LoW’s respect for time, but takes the individual as its anchor. A CB6 “band” is not a rung on a ladder; it is a zone on a spectrum where evidence shows the person delivers reliably and remains in flow. Bands intentionally have fuzzy edges; two bands—Three and Five—are bridge roles placed in the overlaps between horizons, where translation and pacing are the work and organizational tension is deliberate rather than accidental. Where LoW explains what the job demands, CB6 explains how this person tends to perform when those demands meet their current judgment, habits, and scaffolds.

To make placement humane and predictive, the analysis also needs two additional lenses from the same tradition. Capability (Jaques & Cason) concerns a person’s potential to handle complexity as they mature; Mode of Thinking (Stamp) describes the cognitive patterns by which a person frames, interprets, and solves problems over time. Used together, LoW, Capability, Mode of Thinking, and CB6 offer a 4-in-1 language: work, potential, pattern of thinking, and reliable contribution-in-practice.  

## What Each Lens Measures and Why It Matters

### Level of Work: A Role-Anchored View of Complexity

LoW (within Stratified Systems Theory) partitions work into strata by time span of discretion and corresponding decision complexity—from months to many years. It was developed as a way to design equitable structures, clarify accountabilities, and align pay to the true complexity of work. In practice, LoW makes roles legible: it states the by-when and how-complex of a role as designed.  

### Capability: Estimating Potential to Handle Complexity

Capability research (e.g., Human Capability) argues that individuals differ in their current and future capacity to handle complexity and uncertainty, with maturation trajectories that can be estimated and discussed responsibly. Capability does not assign a job; it indicates how far and how fast one might grow, informing long-range development and succession.  

### Mode of Thinking: How People Make Sense of Complexity

Mode of Thinking (Stamp) contributes a qualitative, cognitive view: how people structure problems, detect patterns, and choose actions in conditions of ambiguity and time delay. Methods such as Career Path Appreciation operationalize this perspective through structured interviews that surface how a person frames challenge and time, providing practical inputs for development and placement.  

### Contribution Bands (CB6): Locating Reliable Contribution-in-Practice

CB6 centers on the individual’s demonstrated contribution—where they reliably perform and remain in flow given current supports. It translates time and complexity into six bands with fuzzy edges, and explicitly names bridge roles in the overlaps of horizons: Band Three (Present↔Future) and Band Five (Future↔Enduring). CB6 also treats interpretation as a first-class deliverable: each band translates direction from above into usable designs and standards for below, while surfacing evidence upward. This makes the logic testable in daily governance rather than only at design time. (Conceptual synthesis; see LoW and Mode of Thinking for antecedents.)  

## Distinctions That Prevent Category Errors

### Anchor: Work vs. Person

LoW is job-anchored—it asks, “What time span and complexity does this role require?” CB6 is person-anchored—it asks, “Where does this individual reliably contribute and remain in flow?” Conflating the two leads to misplacement: a job can be Stratum IV by design while a person’s current flow sits in Band Three; forcing a match by title risks failure and disengagement.  

### Boundaries: Thresholds vs. Overlaps

LoW is typically interpreted as thresholded strata; CB6 is designed as overlapping bands with intentionally fuzzy edges, because real work moves across seams. Band Three and Band Five institutionalize those seams as bridge roles that face either adjacent horizon and make organizational tension productive (converting proof to scale; reconciling direction with license).  

### Status: Hierarchy vs. Scale and Scope

LoW is often used to inform hierarchical layering. CB6 decouples band from title: hierarchy and titles vary primarily with scale and scope (stakeholder surface area, capital at risk, ecosystem breadth), not with the band itself. A person can contribute in Band Four as an individual contributor (e.g., principal architect) or as a head of department; the band describes complexity-over-time, not rank.

### Content of Direction: Present Everywhere

Management, Leadership, and Stewardship are present at every band. What changes band-to-band is how they are expressed. CB6 makes this visible in artifacts—standards that hold, platform interfaces, portfolio guardrails—so the cascade from principle to platform to practice can be audited, not merely assumed.

## How They Become Complementary in Practice

### Use LoW to Specify the Work

Design the role using LoW’s time span and decision complexity. This sets the frame for accountability, cadence, and risk posture. The product is a role specification with explicit by-when and how-complex attributes, against which candidates and incumbents can be evaluated.  

### Use Capability and Mode of Thinking to Understand the Person

Estimate a person’s potential trajectory (Capability) and the pattern by which they construe and act in complex situations (Mode of Thinking). Methods such as Career Path Appreciation and its derivatives provide structured, longitudinally studied approaches for this estimation, informing development pathways and succession bets.  

### Use CB6 to Place the Person in Flow and Manage the Seams

Place the person where evidence shows they are in flow now (CB6)—their Flow Band—and, when appropriate, assign one-band stretch with explicit scaffolds. For seam work, designate Band Three or Band Five as bridge roles, make the horizon orientation explicit (e.g., Present-facing Band Three), and name the expected interpretation outputs and latencies. This converts translation loss into a managed variable.

## A Minimal Integration Protocol

1. Specify the job with LoW (time span, system boundary, decision rights).
2. Estimate potential with Capability and pattern with Mode of Thinking (what growth is plausible and how the person frames complexity).
3. Place for reliable contribution with CB6 (Flow Band, orientation at seams, evidence and signals).
4. Align scale and scope to title, not to band (radius of effect can grow without re-banding).
5. Instrument interpretation (fidelity, latency, rework) and delivery signals suited to the horizon.  
   (Protocol synthesizes cited traditions; specific metrics derive from LoW’s by-when logic, Capability/CPA practice, and CB6’s interpretation emphasis.)  

## A Translational Cross-Walk (Narrative, Not Prescriptive)

When LoW specifies a role around ~0–3 months of discretion, CB6 typically observes Band One flow; at ~3–12 months, Band Two; at ~6–24 months across teams, Band Three; at ~1–3 years of platform/interface design, Band Four; at ~2–5 years of portfolio direction with Enduring implications, Band Five; and at ~5–10+ years of identity/license, Band Six. The fit is directional, not categorical: CB6 keeps the edges fuzzy and elevates seam-work as bridge contributions rather than treating the II→III or IV→V transitions as mere thresholds.  

## Implications for Assessment, Development, and Governance

For assessment, the quartet prevents category errors. A person with Capability indications toward longer spans and a Mode of Thinking pattern comfortable with abstraction may still show CB6 evidence of flow one band lower if scaffolds are thin or if the seam work is immature; the answer is designed scaffolding, not automatic promotion. For development, CB6 focuses on one-band stretch with explicit supports and interpretation duties (what the individual will translate and by when). For governance, LoW gives cadence and decision rights; CB6 makes the translation and handoff artifacts explicit; Capability and Mode of Thinking inform where larger bets are warranted. The effect is a coherent system in which work, potential, pattern, and delivery are aligned and auditable.

## Propositions for Research

First, teams with explicit bridge roles (Band Three or Five) and instrumented interpretation signals will show lower translation latency and higher adoption quality than comparable teams that treat seams as ad-hoc escalations. Second, decoupling title from band—letting scale/scope drive hierarchy while CB6 calibrates contribution—will correlate with reduced failure rates in stretch assignments. Third, Capability and Mode of Thinking estimates will moderate the relationship between LoW-specified time span and realized CB6 flow, clarifying when potential converts to sustained contribution. (These propositions integrate LoW’s time-span logic, Capability/CPA practice, and CB6’s seam emphasis.)  

## Conclusion

LoW and CB6 solve different problems at different points in the same pipeline. LoW is anchored on the work that is performed; it stratifies roles by time span and complexity and clarifies accountability. CB6 is centered on the individual and the nature of their work in flow; it identifies where a person reliably contributes now, with fuzzy-edged bands and explicit bridge contributions at the overlaps of horizons. Capability estimates potential trajectory; Mode of Thinking surfaces how a person frames and acts in complexity. Used together, the quartet avoids false certainty (by refusing to collapse person and job into a single label) and avoids vagueness (by making translation artifacts and cadences explicit). The result is precise role design, humane placement, safer stretch, and governance that moves cleanly from principle to platform to practice—so the Present delivers, the Future scales, and the Enduring remains coherent and trusted.
