## Introduction and Academic Context

Gillian Stamp’s **Mode of Thinking** model provides a framework for understanding an individual’s capacity to handle complexity, time horizons, and uncertainty in decision-making (Stamp, 1981; Jaques & Cason, 1994).  It extends **Elliott Jaques’s Stratified Systems Theory (SST)**, which proposes that organizations are structured in levels of increasing complexity, each with a longer time span of discretion.

Stamp’s contribution lies in explaining **why individuals cope differently with complexity** by examining the cognitive processes that underpin their decision-making.  Her model helps assess both **current and potential capability**, offering insight into how individuals develop across time and increasing complexity (Jacobs & Jaques, 1990; Oosthuizen, Coetzee, & Kruger, 2014)

## Theoretical Underpinnings and Integration with Stratified Systems Theory (SST)

The Mode of Thinking model is grounded in **SST’s framework of hierarchical complexity**.  
SST defines distinct “strata” of work, each demanding a different level of abstraction and time horizon.  Stamp’s work extended this by exploring **how individuals’ cognitive growth progresses** through modes of reasoning that align with these strata (Stamp, 1988).

According to Jaques and Cason (1994), human information-processing capability evolves through qualitatively distinct modes such as declarative, cumulative, serial, and parallel reasoning.  
Stamp linked these to organizational levels of work, showing how **each stage of cognitive development corresponds to a distinct level of organizational complexity**.

## Understanding the Mode of Thinking

A **Mode of Thinking** represents an individual’s **potential capability**—the highest level of work complexity they can manage as they mature (Stamp, 1981).  
This potential develops progressively, much like cognitive growth described in developmental psychology, but applied to organizational contexts.  

The model distinguishes between two critical elements:

- **Current Operating Level** — The complexity of problems and timeframes an individual can handle effectively today.  
- **Future Mode** — The potential maximum complexity the individual may handle as their cognitive capacity matures.

This distinction enables organizations to assess both **present fit** and **future readiness** for leadership roles, facilitating long-term development planning (Oosthuizen et al., 2014)

## The Modes of Thinking

Stamp’s framework describes four primary modes of thinking, each representing a distinct way of processing information and approaching complexity.  
As individuals develop, they move from concrete reasoning to abstract, systemic integration.

### Declarative Mode  
The declarative mode focuses on discrete facts and specific observations.  
Thinking is descriptive and concrete, oriented toward immediate results and tangible data.  
This mode is well-suited to work that is procedural, short-term, and clearly defined.

### Cumulative Mode  
The cumulative mode involves adding facts and details in an incremental fashion.  
Individuals can combine information systematically, but their reasoning remains additive rather than causal.  
This mode supports operational work where consistency, accuracy, and attention to detail are critical.

### Serial Mode  
The serial mode introduces linear, cause-and-effect reasoning.  
Individuals can follow and design logical sequences, processes, and procedures that unfold over time.  
This level of thinking aligns with managerial roles that require planning, coordination, and control over multi-step operations.

### Parallel Mode  
The parallel mode integrates multiple, interdependent variables simultaneously.  
It represents a leap into systemic, abstract, and dynamic reasoning.  
Leaders operating at this mode can manage ambiguity, balance competing priorities, and consider long-term consequences—essential for executive and strategic roles.

These modes correspond directly to Jaques’s **Levels of Work**, linking the complexity of thought with the complexity of roles within organizations.

## Link Between SST and the Mode of Thinking

Gillian Stamp’s model complements **Elliott Jaques’s Stratified Systems Theory**, bridging theoretical understanding and practical application.  
Each mode of thinking aligns with a set of organizational strata, defining how individuals and roles interact within the system of work.

### Strata I–II: Concrete and Short-Term Work  
- **Associated Modes:** Declarative and Cumulative  
- **Description:** Work involves short time spans (from a day to a year) and focuses on tangible results.  
- **Example Roles:** Technicians, clerical staff, operators.

### Strata III–IV: Managerial and Tactical Work  
- **Associated Mode:** Serial  
- **Description:** Work involves medium-term planning and linear logic. Managers at these levels coordinate systems and processes.  
- **Example Roles:** Supervisors, department heads, operational managers.

### Strata V–VII: Strategic and Systemic Work  
- **Associated Mode:** Parallel  
- **Description:** Work spans multiple years and requires integrating interdependent systems and uncertainties.  
- **Example Roles:** Executives, CEOs, and organizational stewards.

Stamp’s integration of cognitive capability with SST provides a practical means for aligning **individual potential with organizational complexity**, forming the foundation for leadership assessment through the **Career Path Appreciation (CPA)** interview process.

## Presentation and Application in Academic Literature

In academic and applied contexts, the **Career Path Appreciation (CPA)** serves as the operational tool for assessing a person’s Mode of Thinking.  
Developed by Gillian Stamp in the early 1980s, CPA uses structured interviews and narrative analysis to reveal how individuals perceive, structure, and respond to complexity (Stamp, 1988).

Empirical studies, including those by the **U.S. Army**, demonstrated that CPA results could **predict career progression** and managerial success with strong correlations between assessed potential and actual advancement (Jacobs & Jaques, 1990).  
This predictive validity established the model’s credibility as a developmental and diagnostic instrument.

Unlike intelligence or personality assessments, CPA measures **how people think**, not what they know or how they behave.  
It captures the structural quality of reasoning rather than its content (Streufert & Nogami, 1989; Oosthuizen et al., 2014)

## Comparisons with Other Cognitive and Decision-Making Models

The Mode of Thinking model differs fundamentally from traditional intelligence or personality measures.  
It is a **developmental capacity model**, not a trait-based one.  
While personality models such as MBTI or Hogan describe behavioral tendencies and preferences, Stamp’s framework explores the **architecture of thought**—how individuals make sense of complexity and time.

This makes the model more aligned with **adult cognitive development theories**, such as those of Piaget or Kegan, but tailored for organizational and leadership contexts.  
It emphasizes that the **range and structure of information processing** define the quality of judgment and decision-making (Stamp, 1981; Jaques & Cason, 1994.)

## Critiques, Validations, and Adaptations in Research

Long-term studies have confirmed the **reliability and predictive power** of the CPA assessment (Oosthuizen et al., 2014).  
However, several critiques highlight potential challenges:

- The method’s effectiveness depends on **the skill of the assessor**, as CPA is interpretive rather than quantitative.  
- Misapplication may lead to **deterministic labeling**, implying fixed ceilings of potential.  
- Stamp herself emphasized that **Mode is not a limit**, but a reflection of current developmental potential—a dynamic that can evolve with experience and reflection (Stamp & Stamp, 1993).

Adaptations such as the **Modified CPA** and the integration of Mode of Thinking with personality and values assessments (Lewis, 1993) have broadened its use in modern leadership development, succession planning, and organizational design

## Conclusion

Gillian Stamp’s **Mode of Thinking** model remains a foundational contribution to the study of cognitive complexity and leadership capability.  
It bridges psychology, systems theory, and management science, offering a framework that links how people think with the demands of the work they perform.  

By providing a method to align **individual capability with organizational complexity**, the model has shaped leadership evaluation, talent strategy, and organizational design practices for over four decades.  
Its enduring relevance lies in its humanistic and developmental approach—emphasizing growth, potential, and the dynamic interplay between people and systems.
