## Excerpt

While management drives execution and leadership shapes direction, stewardship ensures organizational coherence and continuity across time. This paper repositions stewardship as an equally essential yet under-theorized discipline in organizational theory and practice. Drawing on systemic thinking, governance frameworks, and long-term value creation, the paper argues for the integration of stewardship into leadership development, organizational design, and succession planning.
## Introduction

Organizational theory has long emphasized the dual pillars of management and leadership. Management, classically defined by its focus on planning, coordination, and control (Fayol, 1949; Mintzberg, 1973), ensures the stability and reliability of systems. Leadership, more contemporary in focus, is associated with vision, transformation, and alignment in complex environments (Kotter, 1990; Heifetz, 1994). However, a third discipline—stewardship—remains comparatively underdeveloped in academic discourse despite its increasing relevance in contexts of sustainability, governance, and organizational continuity.

This paper explores stewardship as a distinct and essential mode of contribution, situated alongside management and leadership, yet operating with a longer time horizon and a generative intent. Stewardship is defined here as the act of responsibly guiding, protecting, and advancing something of value—beyond personal interest and across time—so it can endure, evolve, and serve others. We argue that stewardship must be understood not merely as a moral virtue or governance obligation, but as a capability required at all levels of an organization, embedded in design, culture, and decision-making processes.
## Theoretical Framing: The Triad of Contribution

Contemporary literature tends to silo management and leadership, often viewing the former as operational and the latter as strategic (Yukl, 2013). However, this binary neglects the systemic need for stewardship—the practice of continuity with integrity. Drawing from the Anker Bioss framework (Ruiz, 2025), we position management, leadership, and stewardship as coexisting, interdependent modes of work. Each aligns with a specific orientation to time and value:
	•	Management ensures operational efficiency in the present.
	•	Leadership enables transformation and direction amid complexity.
	•	Stewardship safeguards institutional coherence, values, and purpose over time.

Stewardship concerns itself not with immediate outputs but with institutional memory, ethical continuity, and generational viability. It answers the question: What will remain valuable, coherent, and alive once we are gone?
## Stewardship as a Systemic Discipline

### Beyond Governance Compliance

Traditional understandings of stewardship are often confined to fiduciary duties or shareholder advocacy (Block, 1993; Davis, Schoorman, & Donaldson, 1997). While important, this view is too narrow. Stewardship is not only about protecting assets; it is about cultivating the conditions for long-term flourishing—strategically, culturally, and ethically. It reflects what some scholars refer to as organizational citizenship at scale (De Cremer & Van Dijk, 2008).
### Stewardship Across the Organization

Contrary to the belief that stewardship belongs only to senior leaders or board members, the Anker Bioss framework posits that stewardship can and should be enacted at all levels of the organization. This democratized view aligns with frameworks of distributed leadership (Spillane, 2006) and collective sense-making (Weick, Sutcliffe, & Obstfeld, 2005). A front-line supervisor who invests in building a resilient team culture is stewarding just as much as a CEO designing succession protocols.
### Stewardship and Organizational Capability

Stewardship also intersects with organizational capability—the ability of systems to sustain performance in uncertain environments (Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997). A steward not only sustains culture but evolves it. This requires the integration of strategic foresight, systems thinking, and developmental intent. Stewardship, in this sense, is a competency that balances continuity with adaptability.
### Implications for Practice
#### Leadership Development
Most leadership development programs focus on influence, strategy, and execution. Few integrate stewardship as a developmental arc. Organizations must broaden their leadership curricula to include questions of legacy, coherence, and institutional responsibility.
#### Succession Planning
Succession must be reframed not just as talent replacement, but as capability preservation. Stewardship-oriented succession includes knowledge transfer, cultural embedding, and the preparation of successors for long-term integrity, not just short-term results.
#### Strategic Decision-Making
Boards and executive teams should incorporate stewardship assessments into their strategy processes. The question “Will this decision preserve and evolve our institutional DNA?” should hold equal weight to “Will this increase our EBITDA next quarter?”
#### Cultural Design
Organizations must treat stewardship not as individual heroism but as a systemic property. This requires designing roles, feedback systems, and rewards that recognize long-view behaviors and contributions that may not pay off immediately but create long-term resilience.
## Conclusion

Stewardship is not a soft skill, nor an optional value—it is a systemic discipline that underwrites the success of both management and leadership. Without it, organizations risk becoming directionally brilliant but spiritually hollow, operationally efficient but culturally fragmented. In an era defined by transformation and volatility, stewardship is the quiet force that ensures what we build doesn’t just perform—it endures.

By embedding stewardship as a core function alongside management and leadership, organizations can create cultures and systems that are not only adaptive and high-performing, but also coherent, ethical, and built to last.
