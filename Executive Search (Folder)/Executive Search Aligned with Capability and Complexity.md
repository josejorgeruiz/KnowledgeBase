## A systemic executive search process aligning individual capability with organizational complexity to ensure lasting performance, alignment, and meaningful impact.

At Alder Koten, executive search is not about filling positions. It is about aligning capability with complexity—where individual judgment meets organizational purpose. Every engagement begins with a deep understanding of strategic intent, organizational stage, and cultural context. We look beyond resumes to ensure that leadership capacity matches the level of complexity an organization must navigate to achieve its goals.

Our process is anchored in the Anker Bioss Framework, a systemic architecture that connects how individuals think, decide, and create meaning with the organization’s ability to sustain performance over time. Through this lens, we evaluate not just who can do the job, but who can help the organization evolve.

By aligning individual capability, organizational capability, and strategic complexity, we ensure that every placement strengthens both immediate execution and long-term resilience.
## Discovery Phase

We begin by understanding the organization as a living system. This phase involves analyzing strategic plans, governance structures, and cultural dynamics to reveal the organization’s true stage of development. We identify what the organization requires—and what it can sustain—clarifying role expectations, interdependencies, and the leadership attributes needed to enhance collective performance.

This diagnostic foundation defines the fit between individual and institution, ensuring the search is anchored in both strategic purpose and systemic readiness.
## Fit Definition Stage

The position specification becomes the benchmark for evaluation. It articulates the role’s scope, complexity, and leadership contribution across three essential dimensions of fit:
### Fit to Profile
We define the required profile through the integrated relationship between capability, ability, and capacity:
#### Capability 
Capability reflects how individuals interpret and respond to complexity, demonstrating cognitive depth, judgment, and sense-making in uncertain conditions.
#### Ability
Ability encompasses the applied skills, knowledge, and experience that enable consistent execution and performance in defined contexts.
#### Capacity
Capacity expresses the extent to which capability and ability can be effectively scaled across scope, systems, and time to meet the role’s demands.
### Fit to Company Stage

We analyze the organization’s maturity, systems, and culture to determine how these elements amplify or constrain performance. A leader who thrives in one stage of development may struggle in another; understanding this relationship ensures sustainable success.
### Fit to Challenge

We match the complexity of the strategic challenge with the traits the ideal candidate requires. 

Using the Anker Bioss Framework, we establish the position’s Level of Work (the timespan and complexity of decisions they can manage) and Mode of Thinking (how they make sense of complexity).

This multidimensional definition ensures that the search identifies leaders who are not only competent but also contextually aligned with the organization’s evolution.

## Talent Search Phase

We translate the project specification into a structured search strategy that targets relevant industries, organizations, and leadership ecosystems. Every outreach focuses on identifying individuals whose cognitive orientation, leadership behavior, and cultural alignment match the client’s strategic horizon—not merely their industry pedigree.

Our goal is to surface candidates capable of both delivering in the present and designing the future.
## Assessment and Evaluation Phase

Each candidate is assessed through a rigorous, comparative process that measures not only what they have achieved but how they think, decide, and operate across the three Management Horizons:
#### Present Horizon
The Present Horizon emphasizes consistent delivery, operational reliability, and effective execution—demonstrating how leaders ensure stability and performance in the current system.
#### Future Horizon
The Future Horizon focuses on transformation, guiding strategic evolution, and positioning the organization to adapt, innovate, and thrive amid changing conditions.
#### Enduring Horizon
The Enduring Horizon focuses on sustaining cultural coherence, long-term systems, and values that ensure continuity, purpose, and resilience across generations of leadership.
### Evaluation Tools

We integrate multiple tools in the executive search process to evaluate fit and alignment:
#### Hogan Assessments (HPI, HDS, MVPI)
The Hogan suite evaluates personality drivers, potential derailers, and underlying values that shape motivation, leadership behavior, and interpersonal effectiveness. It helps predict how individuals will perform, relate, and sustain effectiveness under both everyday and high-pressure conditions, offering insight into long-term leadership potential and risk.
#### BIOSS Career Path Appreciation (CPA)
The CPA identifies an individual’s Mode of Thinking—how they make sense of complexity—and Level of Work—the scale and timespan of decisions they can effectively manage. It reveals cognitive patterns that determine a leader’s current and future capacity to navigate uncertainty, structure decisions, and enable strategic alignment.
#### Luks Prisma Leadership Assessment
The Luks Prisma Leadership Assessment explores leadership style, role preference, and motivational drivers across six dimensions, providing a nuanced picture of how leaders think, act, and engage within systems. It ensures alignment between natural leadership expression, organizational culture, and the role’s systemic and developmental requirements.

This phase transforms data into insight—illuminating how leaders will respond to complexity, shape teams, and sustain flow within the organizational system.
## Presentation and Interview Phase

Shortlisted candidates are presented through confidential reports that integrate biographical detail with strategic interpretation. Each report includes education, training, experience, and—most critically—our analysis of the candidate’s fit across the defined dimensions: profile, stage, and challenge.

These presentations enable our clients to engage in interviews informed by clarity, not conjecture.

## Validation Phase
We conduct 360-degree reference checks and academic verifications within the defined framework. References are used not only to confirm performance history but to validate how the candidate contributes to capability, aligns with culture, and sustains results across time horizons.

## Offer Phase
The offer stage is navigated as a process of alignment, not negotiation. We facilitate transparent dialogue between candidate and client, ensuring the agreement reflects shared expectations, purpose, and growth potential. Our role is to balance interests and ensure that the relationship begins with clarity and mutual trust.

## Transition Phase
Our engagement extends beyond the signed offer. We remain connected through resignation, onboarding, and integration to ensure early success and sustained alignment.

Through the Anker Bioss perspective, we provide post-placement feedback that supports both leader and organization in achieving flow—the state where challenge and capability balance to create high performance and deep engagement.
This final step transforms hiring into a systemic intervention, ensuring that individual capability amplifies organizational capacity rather than being constrained by it.
## Status and Reporting

A structured process brings certainty to the uncertainty of search. Throughout the engagement, we provide progress reports and insight notes summarizing outreach outcomes, candidate responses, and strategic observations.

We recommend review calls every two weeks to ensure synchronization and alignment as the process evolves. Transparency, rhythm, and shared accountability form the foundation of every successful search.

## Working with Jose J. Ruiz on Executive Search Projects

Executive search, when done well, is a form of organizational design. It is not about acquiring talent—it is about ensuring that the right individual, with the right capability and judgment, enters the right system at the right moment in its evolution.

When individual capability meets organizational complexity in flow, performance becomes sustainable, culture becomes coherent, and leadership becomes legacy.
