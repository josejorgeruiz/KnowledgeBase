## [Alder Koten](https://alderkoten.com/) was founded in February 2011 in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico, by Silvia Flores, who envisioned a firm dedicated to aligning leadership capability with organizational complexity. 

From its inception, the firm focused on helping clients build leadership teams that not only perform but evolve—bridging talent strategy, organizational design, and purpose-driven leadership. Jose J. Ruiz supported the founding as Chairman of the Board, contributing strategic guidance and systemic frameworks that would later shape the firm’s consulting philosophy.

Later that same year, Silvia relocated to Houston, Texas, and Alder Koten moved its headquarters to The Woodlands, TX, positioning the firm to serve cross-border clients operating across Mexico and the United States. The early years were marked by rapid growth and the establishment of a leadership team that reflected the firm’s international reach and commitment to excellence.

In June 2012, Jorge Dávalos joined as Managing Partner in the Houston office, strengthening the firm’s executive search capabilities in North America. Simultaneously, Felipe Llaguno joined as Managing Partner in Monterrey, anchoring the firm’s presence in Northern Mexico and supporting industrial and manufacturing clients.

A year later, in June 2013, Jose J. Ruiz formally assumed the role of CEO and Managing Partner, integrating the firm’s search practice with a more systemic approach to leadership evaluation and organizational alignment. That same year, in October 2013, Carlos Solórzano joined as Managing Partner in Guadalajara, Mexico, expanding the firm’s national footprint and client reach.

On August 24, 2014, Alder Koten became a member of the IMD International Search Group, a global executive search organization founded in 1972. IMD is composed of independently owned firms operating in more than 20 countries, collaborating to conduct senior executive and board-level searches across borders. Each member retains its identity and autonomy while sharing IMD’s commitment to quality, ethics, and cultural fit. This partnership positioned Alder Koten as a bridge between America and global markets, enabling clients to access world-class talent and leadership insight through an integrated global network.

In 2021, Jose J. Ruiz was elected President of IMD International Search Group, leading the network through a period of modernization and global collaboration. In May 2025, he transitioned from President to Chairman of IMD, where he continues to guide the organization’s strategic direction and governance.

Most recently, in June 2023, Gilda Ramos joined Alder Koten as Engagement Manager in the Houston office, further strengthening the firm’s executive recruiting and candidate engagement capabilities.

Today, Alder Koten is a boutique executive search and leadership advisory firm with nine partners. Its headquarters are located in Houston and it has offices in Guadalajara, Monterrey, and Mexico City with partner firms in New York, Boston, Chicago, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Hong Kong, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and United Kingdom. The firm continues to operate at the intersection of executive search, leadership assessment, and organizational alignment—anchored by the conviction that meaningful work, when enabled by capable leadership and coherent systems, is the foundation of enduring organizational success.

Alder Koten, as an executive search and leadership advisory firm, is built on the principle that executive search is not about filling positions—it’s about aligning talent capability with organizational capability, and the challenge at hand. From its inception, the firm differentiated itself by integrating deep leadership assessment and organizational diagnostics into every search engagement.
