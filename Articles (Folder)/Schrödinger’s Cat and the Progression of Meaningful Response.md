## Schrödinger’s Cat as an invitation into ambiguity

Schrödinger’s Cat is one of the most famous thought experiments in physics. Erwin Schrödinger imagined a sealed box containing a cat, a tiny piece of radioactive material, a Geiger counter, and a vial of poison connected to the detector. If an atom decays, the Geiger counter triggers, the vial breaks, and the cat dies. If no decay occurs, nothing happens and the cat remains alive. The setup is designed so that after a defined period, there is a 50% chance the atom has decayed and a 50% chance it has not.

Quantum mechanics describes the atom during that period as being in a *superposition* of both decayed and not decayed. If you extend that logic to the entire system, the cat becomes entangled with the atom and is described as both alive and dead at the same time—at least in the mathematics—until an observer opens the box and looks. The moment of observation “collapses” the superposition into a definite outcome: the cat is either alive *or* dead, not both.

Schrödinger proposed this scenario to highlight how strange quantum rules look when applied to everyday objects. The image escaped the physics community and became a metaphor for ambiguous situations: circumstances that are many things at once until we look closely and decide what we are actually dealing with.

Leadership lives inside these kinds of boxes every day. Markets shift, signals conflict, people disagree on what is happening, and organizations often act before they have truly “opened the box” together. This is exactly where my concept of the *Progression of Meaningful Response* comes in.

## The unopened box as organizational turbulence

Organizational turbulence often feels like standing in front of a sealed box. Performance metrics wobble, customer feedback becomes noisier, regulatory pressure increases, or internal politics intensify. Everyone senses that something important is happening, but nobody agrees on what, why, or what to do next.

The Progression of Meaningful Response begins with this reality. Leaders do not begin with answers; they begin with *sense*. The progression—Sense-Making, Meaning-Making, Framing, and Solving—is a disciplined sequence for converting volatility into coherent action. It exists precisely because most organizations react to turbulence by escalating activity rather than deepening understanding.

The unopened box represents that pre-progression state. People speculate, defend their viewpoints, and rush to initiatives without a shared picture of reality. The organization behaves as if it already knows whether the cat is alive or dead while the box is still firmly shut.

## The problem in superposition

Unresolved situations in organizations sit in a kind of conceptual superposition. A single pattern of symptoms supports multiple plausible explanations at once:

- Revenue softness is simultaneously a pricing issue, a product-market fit issue, and a sales capability issue.  
- Attrition is simultaneously about compensation, leadership quality, and role design.  
- A governance breakdown is simultaneously about process, culture, and strategy.

Before the Progression of Meaningful Response is applied, all these interpretations coexist. Different stakeholders hold different “versions of reality,” and each version carries its own implied solutions. The organization’s “cat” is alive and dead, internal and external, tactical and strategic, all at the same time.

This is where the analogy with Schrödinger’s Cat is most useful. In the thought experiment, the superposition is a property of the quantum system. In organizations, the superposition is a property of our *unexamined narratives*. The system is ambiguous because we have not yet done the work of stabilizing what is happening, why it matters, and what we are truly going to treat as the problem worth solving.

## Sense-Making: opening the box

Sense-Making is the act of opening the box. It answers the question, **What is happening?** It is the disciplined construction of a shared, minimally sufficient picture of reality under conditions of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity.

In practice, Sense-Making means shifting from opinion to observation. I privilege patterns over noise, and I insist on clear distinctions between data and interpretation. I want to know:

- What we can actually see and measure.  
- Where the signals converge or diverge.  
- Which perspectives we have included and which we have ignored.

The point is not to create a perfect model; the point is to stabilize perception enough that we are no longer arguing about basic facts while pretending to solve. In Schrödinger’s terms, this is the moment when we stop guessing from the outside and finally open the box. We look together, with instruments in hand, and describe what we observe.

Without this stage, everything that follows rests on sand. Premature Solving is nothing more than betting on the cat’s state from outside the box.

## Meaning-Making: deciding why the cat matters

Meaning-Making is the next discipline. It answers the question, **What does this mean?** Once Sense-Making gives us a clearer picture of what is happening, Meaning-Making links that picture to identity, purpose, values, and stakes.

In my work, this is the moment where I ask:

- Why does this situation matter *to us*, now?  
- Who is affected, and over what time span?  
- What is at risk if we act—or fail to act?

Meaning-Making transforms cognitive clarity into motivational coherence. People will not commit deeply to work that is technically well-defined but emotionally empty. Without Meaning-Making, execution becomes clever but hollow, and alignment decays as different groups pursue their own implicit agendas.

In the Schrödinger analogy, once the box is open, the cat’s state becomes a story about something larger. If the cat is alive, the conversation becomes a story about resilience, probability, or experimental design. If the cat is dead, the conversation becomes a story about responsibility, ethics, or the limits of the model. The raw fact does not carry meaning on its own; we supply meaning by placing it in a narrative that explains why it matters.

Organizations work the same way. A 10% revenue drop is just a number until it is interpreted. It might be framed as a normal correction, a structural inflection point, or a symptom of strategic exhaustion. Meaning-Making is where that interpretation is made explicit and shared.

## Framing: collapsing to the problem worth solving

Framing is the hinge in the progression. It answers the question, **What do we need to solve?** Once we know what is happening and why it matters, we still face a choice: of all the possible interpretations and entry points, which one will we treat as the primary problem worth solving now?

Framing defines the challenge, names constraints, chooses the lens, and clarifies success criteria. Good frames are explicit about the lens they adopt and honest about the lenses they set aside. They define boundaries and time horizons so that the organization can choose proportionate methods.

In terms of the cat, Framing is the moment we stop talking about “quantum weirdness” in general and decide what the experiment is actually about. Are we using it to explore the role of observation, the nature of measurement, or the boundary between quantum and classical behavior? Each frame will drive different questions, experiments, and interpretations.

In organizational terms, Framing might sound like this:

- “Given what we see and why it matters, our central problem is not revenue in general; it is the erosion of our economic logic in Segment A over the next 18 months.”  
- “Our core challenge is not ‘culture’ as a whole; it is the absence of challenge and escalation in decisions that cross functions at the Level 4 horizon.”  

When I frame, I am collapsing the superposition into a chosen reality for the next cycle of work. I recognize that other interpretations exist, but I deliberately select one as the main object of effort, so that teams can focus and methods can match the problem.

## Solving: designing interventions for the chosen reality

Solving is the culmination of the progression. It answers the question, **How do we solve this?** Once the problem is framed, Solving designs and delivers interventions matched to the scale and nature of that problem.

Mature Solving integrates analysis, creativity, experimentation, and disciplined execution. It uses feedback loops to keep the upstream disciplines alive, so that new learning can trigger renewed Sense-Making, fresh Meaning-Making, and adjustments to the frame.

In the Schrödinger metaphor, Solving is not endless debate about whether the cat is alive or dead. Solving is deciding what to do with what we have seen and chosen:

- Do we refine the experimental setup?  
- Do we change our interpretation of measurement?  
- Do we reframe the whole thought experiment?  

In organizations, Solving might involve redesigning the product portfolio, re-architecting the operating model, shifting pricing, changing governance, or building new capabilities. The key is that these actions are no longer guesses launched from outside the box. They are responses aligned with a shared reality, a shared meaning, and a clear frame.

## Premature Solving: betting on the cat

Premature Solving is the most common failure pattern I see in leadership teams. Activity spikes, new initiatives multiply, and people work harder than ever—yet effectiveness declines. When I look closely, I almost always find the same underlying issue: the organization has jumped straight to Solving without doing sufficient Sense-Making, Meaning-Making, or Framing.

This behavior is the organizational equivalent of betting heavily on whether the cat is alive or dead while refusing to open the box. Leaders choose solutions that match their preferred narrative and then push the system to execute, even though the shared reality has not been stabilized.

In decision environments where knowledge is low and control is limited, this is especially destructive. High-certainty, high-control methods applied in low-knowledge, low-control situations generate rework, erode credibility, and exhaust teams. The remedy is not to push harder; the remedy is to step back into the progression: reopen Sense-Making, re-author Meaning-Making, and reframe the problem before trying to solve again.

## From individual discipline to institutional language

The Progression of Meaningful Response begins as an individual discipline. A single leader can use it internally:

- First, I steady my perception: **What is happening?**  
- Then, I connect it to purpose: **What does this mean?**  
- Next, I define focus: **What do we need to solve?**  
- Finally, I design action: **How do we solve this?**

Over time, the progression becomes an institutional language. Teams learn to say things like:

- “We are arguing about solutions; we haven’t opened the box yet.”  
- “We know what is happening, but we haven’t agreed what it means for us.”  
- “We feel urgency, but we haven’t framed the problem worth solving.”  

At that point, the organization is no longer held hostage by every wave of turbulence. It has a repeatable grammar for moving from sensing to acting, and for noticing where it is stuck. The “cat” in each situation may change—revenue, culture, governance, strategy—but the movement from superposition to shared reality remains the same.

## Closing: opening the box together

Leadership in complex environments is not about having the right answer in advance. It is about guiding people through the disciplined sequence that makes meaningful answers possible. Schrödinger’s Cat reminds us that ambiguity is not just a nuisance; it is built into the way systems behave when we do not yet know what we are looking at.

The Progression of Meaningful Response is my way of “opening the box” with others. Sense-Making stabilizes what is happening. Meaning-Making explains why it matters. Framing decides what we will treat as the problem worth solving. Solving turns that choice into coherent, proportionate action.

When leaders respect this sequence, they stop betting on the cat and start looking together. They trade motion for momentum, noise for narrative, and scattered initiatives for responses that are genuinely meaningful—across time, complexity, and the lives entrusted to their decisions.
